**Campaign finance reports show troubling connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to Trump and top Republican leaders.**

 *This column originally published December 15, 2017* 

&amp;#x200B;

As Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team probes deeper into potential collusion between Trump officials and representatives of the Russian government, investigators are taking a closer look at political contributions made by U.S. citizens with close ties to Russia.

Buried in the campaign finance reports available to the public are some troubling connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to President Donald Trump and a number of top Republican leaders. And thanks to changes in campaign finance laws, the political contributions are legal. We have allowed our campaign finance laws to become a strategic threat to our country.

..snip..

Data from the Federal Election Commission show that \[Len\] Blavatnik's campaign contributions dating back to 2009-10 were fairly balanced across party lines and relatively modest for a billionaire. During that season he contributed $53,400. His contributions increased to $135,552 in 2011-12 and to $273,600 in 2013-14, still bipartisan.

In 2015-16, everything changed. Blavatnik's political contributions soared and made a hard right turn as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees, with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham.

In 2017, donations continued, with $41,000 going to both Republican and Democrat candidates, along with $1 million to McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund.

.. long snip, detailed connections between Russian Oligarchs and American business leaders..

Why did GOP PACs and other Trump-controlled funds take their money? Why didn't the PACs say, ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" like the Republicans said to Shustorovich in 2000? Yes, it was legal to accept their donations, but it was incredibly poor judgment.

McConnell surely knew as a participant in high level intelligence briefings in 2016 that our electoral process was under attack by the Russians. Two weeks after the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement in October 2016 that the Russian government had directed the effort to interfere in our electoral process, McConnell's PAC accepted a $1 million donation from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings. The PAC took another $1 million from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings on March 30, 2017, just 10 days after former FBI Director James Comey publicly testified before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's interference in the election.

Did I hear Cory say he wants a tax credit given to people who spend more than 1/3 of their income on rent? I'm pretty sure that's how he put it saying that Warrens plan creates ghettos. Well...

Here in Dubuque, IA a person can pay $500/month and live okay (I pay even less but it's kind of a shithole). So at $6000/year in rent paid you'd have to make less than $18,000/year to qualify for this. And I haven't done the math on what you'd be paying in income taxes (to be forgiven by Cory) if you make less than 18,000/year but it's nowhere near $6000. It's basically nothing. This plan seems toothless.

Also the section 8 housing program, not very unlike Cory's plan, that we have in place here in town, given the limitations of infrastructure and the machinations of government, creates ghettos and gentrification anyway.

Also this idea creates a lot of arbitrary cutoff points. The logic of not having a cutoff is not strange to your friend Andrew Yang; ask him to explain to you how not to create a *benefit cliff*


  This is important because rent is the largest line item cost for America's poorest people. Cory is at least aiming at the right target (most politicians aren't) but he's no Robin Hood.  
  You can tighten this up just by making it a cash voucher, maybe even one that scales with how much rent you pay as a percentage of your income. You know, Yangify it, just a hair. Then you can have the best of Yang logic without the free-for-all he's proposing. (I love Yang but goddamn)

AND, if you do this in addition to Warren building projects TOGETHER in the same areas the corresponding rising and lowering of market rent prices will cancel each other out, mitigating the interference with the market!

Trump has been hinting regularly that he will just cancel the 2020 election if it doesn't look like he will win or will refuse to hold a 2024 election and remain in office indefinitely. His supporters have also often suggested declaring all opponents -- both Democratic candidates and their supporters -- to be traitors to the country. It was suggested that because the US has been in a state of war since 2001, the military can hold tribunals to put critics of Trump into internment camps as traitors. We've seen this happen in many other countries but would it be possible in the US? What what would happen if Trump did try to declare himself President-for-Life and his opponents traitors to the country?

2019 is on pace to show the weakest job growth since 2011.

""But trade wars good!""

Trade wars have increased consumer prices, weakened growth, wages and reduced jobs, resulting in a major economic cost.

""But the tax cuts""

The tax cuts have added about $2 trillion to budget deficits this decade and have mostly benefited the very wealthy. This, along with an explosion of military spending is contributing to about a $1 trillion annual budget deficit for 2019. This is a long-term cost we will all pay for one way or the other. Deficits matter.

 [https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/07/29/trumps-budget-deficits-could-almost-double-obamas/#4d17f3b77693](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/07/29/trumps-budget-deficits-could-almost-double-obamas/#4d17f3b77693)

The tax cuts have been a weak stimulus at best and have produced mainly stock buybacks, not jobs or investment.

&amp;#x200B;

""But GDP""

Annual GDP topped out at 2.9% in 2018, artificially fueled by increased federal borrowing, no higher than Obama's top years, which happened during the sequester that weakened growth. It's weaker this year. Trump promised 6% growth originally, then lowered it to 5%, then 4%. Not happening.

Other long-term costs:

Deregulation is generally not a good thing. It lead to the Great Recession.

 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/business/economy/26inquiry.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/business/economy/26inquiry.html)

Environmental deregulation has economic costs and the Trump administration is grossly overestimating costs of regulation.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the popular responses to Trump's economic claims are of the variety ""economy does not excuse his poor leadership and corruption"", ""wall street isn't main street"", ""jobs added aren't quality jobs"", ""health care costs are rising"", ""wealth gap increasing"", ""money isn't everything"", which are valid responses, but why not challenge the claims more directly? Emphasize the above 3 points. He inherited a great economy, the trajectory has weakened, and his policies are causing both short-term and long-term damage.",1

Reddit Democrat Readers:

I'm not a published journalist and I have never studied political science or criminology. By no means am I trying to be an expert, but simply posing the following question: At what point do we draw the line in the sand between racial discrimination, and profiling based on quantitative data? 

Yes, SQF - Stop, Question and Frisk, otherwise known as Stop-and-Frisk, or the law that the rich 'ol, white billionaire put in place while he was a Republican Mayor of New York City (yes, Mike Bloomberg).  

When analyzing the data reported by NYC Open Data ([https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8)), there are a total of 20,659 shooting incidents, of which 12,028 have the reported perpetrator racial profile. Of those 12,028 (or, roughly 60% of the total data), Blacks account for 74% of total incidents; White Hispanics account for 15%; and Black Hispanics account for 9%. This results in 98% of the 12,028 reported incidents being Black or Hispanic with remaining 2% comprised of White, Asian/Pacific Islanders or American Indian/Alaskan Whites. 

Being that 98% of shooting incidents were accounted for by Blacks and Hispanics, how does one decide that ""fitting a relevant description"" is racially discriminatory? I mean, what exactly defines ""fitting a relevant description"" in the first place? If I lived in Brooklyn, and 97% of all shooting incidents in my borough was accounted for by Blacks and Hispanics, I think the NYPD could classify a Black and Hispanic as fitting the racial profile.

I think Mike Bloomberg is getting more heat than necessary, and people shouldn't be so focused on SQF.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, when it comes to Booker's comment on being ""taken aback"" by the ""well-spoken"" comment. Give me a break. Booker is obviously articulate and well-spoken, and what's wrong with Bloomberg acknowledging that? I know white people that wouldn't be worthy of the compliment well-spoken, and I know black people that aren't worthy of the same. Can't we acknowledge that Bloomberg was complimenting Booker?",1

Hey guys.

I'm feeling a bit critical here.  I dislike Trump just as much as the next sane person, but the attitude of the Republicans treating this term as more of a sports game, and less of a country working together has stressed me out a bit.  It feels like it's less about the country's best interests in their eyes at this point, and more about ""winning"" against the Democrats, or whatever their definition of that seems to be at this point.  I mean, they're trying to take away food stamps, social security, medicare, and planned parenthood just to make up the deficits they've created from giving tax cuts to corporations and wall street, and that seems pretty backwater to me...

While it's great to hear that the Democrats are working to get Trump removed from office, why are they only (at least at surface level) only focusing on the Ukraine incident?  We have clear other violations of the constitution that have been done, such as violating the Emoluments Clause, Obstruction of Justice, Witness Tampering, Witness Intimidation, Campaign Finance Violations, and those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  It makes me pretty furious to hear that Trump has used $115 million of taxpayer money to go golfing at his OWN GOLF resorts while in office, and even more upset to hear that, according to public record, he's spent more time vacationing than being the President of the United States.

I feel like it's going to be almost impossible given the attitude of the Republicans to get him on convicted or removed in the Senate on only the Ukraine incident.  Has there been any additional information about other sections of the Constitution that Trump has violated while holding office?  Have the Democrats leading the Impeachment Committee signaled that there's more than the Ukraine incident being used as a basis for impeachment?  It seems almost surreal that Clinton was removed for lying about having a consensual sexual relationship with a staffer, but Trump lying nonstop about large issues that effect the economy, violating the constitution on multiple accounts, and blatant abuses of power somehow is being washed over by the Republicans.

It just feels like they need more convincing, which is pretty hard to believe at this point....",1

Question , do you think that Dems should be ramping up the PR struggle to inform the apathetic public exactly what Trump has done and is doing? I think it's been badly mishandled from the start. Why aren't the candidates, Obama, Bill Clinton etc hammering away about this?

After listening to the hearing today, I find myself agreeing with Professor Turley. We need the direct evidence that those witnesses can provide. I do not believe this political argument that we need to do it quickly is right. We need to accurately write articles of impeachment, and that includes expanding the scope and being able to drag these Republicans, kicking and screaming, to take their medicine. I believe that the President committed bribery. I believe he should be impeached and removed, and I want him to be. We need to get the evidence to prove what he did, from the mouths of the people complicit in this scheme. If we get that evidence, then this president will be removed or possibly resign. 

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but we need to do this. If we are going to do this process, let’s do it 100%. Anything less will only lend credence to the exact actions we are trying to fight against. 

This is to protect our democracy. Not the Democratic Party. It’s time to act like it and make choices not based on strategy, but on having a more thorough investigation, until we arrive with the facts, wether we like the outcome or not.",1

2 words, Vice President. 
(First post btw, hi everyone, greetings from Canada)
Kamala said that she’s dropping out because of lack of funds, but (according to wikipedia at the time I checked a few minutes ago) she raised about the same amount as Biden, so that doesn’t seem like a really true issue. What was an issue though, was her poll numbers, they were absolutely horrible for someone who had so much momentum. And based off of the debates, she definitely would want to take Biden down,and who’s one of the top contenders to do that, Pete Buttigieg. What’s Pete currently struggling with though in his campaign to beat Biden, the back vote. So in my opinion, there is definite motive for her to drop out, and become Pete’s running mate to gain black voters and beat Biden together as a team by swaying more centre Democrats to them instead. Does anyone else think this will happen, or do you think this seems outlandish by some evidence I may have missed.

TLDR: Kamala dropped out to give Pete a running mate to sway black voters away from Biden because they both see him as a large opponent, do you think this will happen as well?",1

t3_e4zuxr,43,"A couple of observations on cherry picking.
A recent post on reddit noted how selective news reporting is a major, maybe the major, problem today. Such ""selecting"" is basically cherry picking. I strongly urge people to meditate long, hard and continuously on the basic idea of cherry picking. Along the lines of the cause of meditation/thought, these observations occurred to me recently:

1. The senatorial system is as case of cherry picking. Accepting it, that is. By accepting the rules that govern how many senators there are per state, the outcome (2 per state) is a kind of cherry picked outcome. The challenge here is to grasp just how this is a case of cherry picking. This is most important because in as much as the senatorial system is a continuous, structural condition of US democracy, it serves to acclimate people to the basic logic and conditions of cherry picking. In particular, it fosters and enforces a tolerance of cherry picking, even simply as a sheer ability to ""get over it"" when one notes that, ""gee, that doesn't seem like fair representation given the populations of South Dakota compared to California"". This obviously goes for the Electoral College, and then there's Gerrymandering...
2. This comes from somewhere else altogether: basket ball games. Two teams battle it out, and wind if with the final score: 91 to 90. First, of course, it's important to grasp just how this is a case of cherry picking (I would suggest it is). Then there's the whole ""forced acclimation"" (""hey, that's how the game is set up, accept the winner/loser situation as part of the system""). This causes people to simply get over the natural tendency to point out that you can't have a simple ""winner take all"" glory of victory when the score is that high and that close.

t3_e3idir,47,"""The US just had its last Thanksgiving in NATO""
Has anyone else heard that Trump plans to announce plans to withdraw from NATO once he is reelected in 2020?

Several news stories are pointing that way now.  Here is what I know from these and some other sources:

- Putin secretively spoke with Trump while on the trip to Afghanistan, which is on the eve of the NATO summit in London. He was able to do so there without violating government rules on disclosure, since they are enforceable only within the US. In the past, this limitation has allowed Trump to tear up translators' notes after a conference with Putin, without risk of enforceable subpoenas from Congress.

- Putin has been doing Trump a tremendous service in helping him overcome the impeachment actions, particularly by pushing the lie about Ukrainian interference, and funding Republican campaigns in Congress with the deal that they would parrot these lies during the impeachment hearings. Russia has also bought out the Senate already.  All that is even more valuable than Russian assistance with the 2016 election. Trump understands the commensurate expectations, and the support could unravel on Putin's whim.

- Trump plans to secure Putin's intent to assist him with the 2020 election, since to stay in office gives Trump immunity from Federal prosecution. In fact, he is relying squarely on Putin for that. He is therefore going to complete withdrawal from Syria by Christmas this year and turn his back on the region so that Putin can get his leverage over both Turkey and Syria.

- Trump does not care about Ukraine and has promised Putin no real opposition if Russia attempts to annex the country completely.  NATO agreements must be out of effect if that is to work. Russia has plans to complete the takeover of Ukraine by the end of 2021.

- Trump is very concerned that Putin will have no reason to keep the 'komprimat' suppressed once he is reelected, when his need for Putin will diminish.  Trump will have to play ball and give Putin his ultimate prize, which is a full NATO withdrawal while Congress is in recess after the election.

- Trump also plans to stop enforcing the Magnitsky Act in his second term, which will restore Putin's access to billions in personal wealth. Putin can then use this money to directly help Trump, both during and after his Presidency.

- To the last point, Trump is open to asylum for himself and his family in Russia, if there's no more that can be done.  He might do so by putting on a state visit to Russia, with his family at his side, and then resign from office while there.

See below.

And add your own below!

You probably know all about the impeachment stuff, but the trump fans will always run back to ""but the economy is booming"". A few notes. 

GDP growth is 1.9 percent, which is below Obama's average. Reagan and clinton often got to 4 to 5 percent and trump called under 3 failure. Trump has not had an annual average over 3 percent yet. 

Trump has created fewer jobs than Obama's best years. And trump's average is about on par with Obama's average years. https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/09/20/trump-has-created-15-million-fewer-jobs-than-obama/

Labor force participation rate (a favorite topic of trump fans during the election) has changed almost none. 

u6 unemployment rate, which many trump fans said was the ""real rate"" on 2016, is 7 percent. 

The deficit is already over a trillion for this year. According to the debt clock. And we have a month left. Obama's only deficits over a trillion were in the depths of the recession. But trump has a booming economy? 

The fed slashed the rate for a third time in a row last month, that means they think the economy is weak.

Everyone that is biologically related to me are Christian, conservative, and Republican (and practically worship Trump). So, they have hateful and closed-minded views, like gay marriage is wrong, transgenderism is a mental illness, LGBT+ people are mentally ill, abortion is murder and people who get pregnant should always be forced to stay pregnant whether they like it or not, Mexicans are taking all our jobs and are all rapists and should be treated poorly, discrimination is okay, Liberals/Democrats are mentally unstable and delusional, etc. On the other hand, I am an atheist, liberal, and Democrat. Ironically, I am ""out of the closet"" about that those things to everyone everywhere, except my biological relatives. I am probably never going to tell them I am atheist, liberal, Democrat, bisexual, etc., because they probably would never accept me, or maybe even try to hurt/disown me.

Also, is it okay to not respect hateful views? Because my relatives demand that Democrats and Liberals respect their views, but, ironically, my relatives don't seem to respect the Liberals'/Democrats' views.

(Also, I may ask more questions like this in the future, if this is an okay place to do so; I am young and still trying to find my place in politics and the world in general).",1

*Skip down to no. 7*

7. ""What you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal.""

What is Trump even talking about here? Presumably that there was some sort of ""deep state"" conspiracy aimed at trying to keep him from winning in 2016? No matter what it is, it's going to be BIG. BIGGEST.

8. ""I think you're going to see things that are going to be incredible if it's -- if it's done right. And I purposely stay out.""

This was Trump's ""answer"" when pressed about what, exactly, he was talking about in regards to the biggest scandal in American history. My favorite part? How he adds the ""if it's done right"" -- handing himself an out when nothing happens to say it was a coverup. Truly astounding.""

t3_dzwcqn,33,"Clinton Impeachment - Reflections
I found an old Oregonian News Paper from 1998, in which the article is titled - ""Impeachment: In Their Own Words"", and it includes statements and reactions politicians had to the failure of the Impeachment of Then-President William Jefferson Clinton. 

Needless to say, what the Republicans had to say about it reveals how much the party has changed from their core values. In their statements from 1998 compared to their actions of today highlight the trnsformation and hypocrisy of the Republican Party. 

Just imagine if these quotes and values were applied to the Republicans during the Impeachment Proceedings against Trump. 

To republicans, I guess a blowjob in the oval office is enough to Impeach. If Adultery is enough to impeach, then Trump should've never been a republican candidate. 

With that I'll just get into it:

-------
I tried my best to transcribe the text from the wrinkly torn paper

""When you have a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law enforcement officer to United States you have a problem"" - House judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill

""We cannot allow the president of the United States to abuse his trust and the great authorities of his office. Not telling the truth about how some transgressions will spawn great big transgressions and they will spread like a cancer across America’s character"" - House majority leader Dick Armey, R-Texas
 
""Today our votes and our consciences must be based on these three great pillars of the rule of law - the law itself, the evidence and the constitution"" - Rep Bob Barr, R-Ga  ( NOT AG William Barr )

""We must reject censure because the president’s defence rests squarely, we must sadly conclude on the denial of the obvious and the assertion of pure nonsense.” - Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla

""Every single man and woman in Operation Desert Fox at this very moment is held to a higher standard than their commander in chief. Let us raise the standard of our American Leader to the level of his troops. Let us once again respect the institution of the presidency... Let us not fail in our duty. Let us restore honor to our country” - Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif

""I bear no animosity toward the president. I do not wish him ill. Clearly any sins that may have been committed are between him and the Lord. And any infidelities must remain between him and his family. But we cannot deny the damage that has been done to his office and to our nation"" - Rep Marge Roukema, R-N.J.


""There is no joy sometimes in upholding the law. It is so unpleasant sometimes that we hire other people to do it for us. Ask the Police or the Judges. It is tiring and thankless, but we know it must be done, because if we do not point at lawlessness, our children cannot see it. 
“ If we do not label lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. And if we do not punish lawlessness, our children will not believe it. So if someone were to ask me, “JC, why do you vote for, why did you vote for the articles of impeachment”, I would say, “ I did it for our children"" -Rep. J.C Watts, R-Okla. 

Democrats

“ Our Founding Fathers created a system of government of men, not of angels...We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the altar of an unattainable morality...Let us step back from the abyss and let us begin a new politics of respect and fairness and decency” - House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo

“The politics of personal smear is degrading the dignity of public office and we must not let it continue. We must put an end to it. And the only way we will stop this vicious cycle is if we stand up and refuse to give in to it.” - House Minority Whip David Bonoir, D-Mich. 

“We’re going to become a nation where people who have sins - and everyone of us is a sinner - will be afraid to enter the ranks of public service. Is that what we want?” - Rep. Thomas Barnett, D-Wis.

We know [for a fact](https://www.eff.org/issues/patriot-act) that the government has used it to violate our constitutional and human rights. But House Democrats [just included](https://twitter.com/evan_greer/status/1196539097596039169) a three month straight reauthorization of the Patriot Act in the “Continuing Resolution” must pass spending bill. **And the Congress is voting on it TODAY.**

Representatives like [AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1196573088214867968), [Justin Amash](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1196531183091355649), and [Ilhan Omar](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1196594212822753280) have already tweeted that they will vote against this. Please retweet, thank them, and amplify that so we can get other reps on board. This is not a partisan issue, so contact your reps regardless of which party they’re part of.

Our friends at Restore the Fourth have [**a simple tool**](http://decidethefuture.org/) that lets you look up where your reps stand on surveillance and tweet at them. **Below are the 20 or so members of Congress who are either most likely to vote against the CR today or who have the most control over the process. Tweet and call them right now and tell them: “Vote NO on the Continuing Resolution because it reauthorizes the Patriot Act!”**

t3_dyxi1z,81,"Why do states hold primaries on different days? Does my primary vote even matter?
I’ve never understood why states hold primary voting on different days. It seems like a lot of candidates will drop out before much of the country gets to vote. Voters in the early voting states might have different priorities than voters in late voting states. How do we know a great candidate won’t be shut out because, for example, their message doesn’t resonate as well in Iowa like it would in Maryland?

And while nobody is obligated to participate, it benefits everyone for the federal government to have an accurate count of everyone living here. 

EVERYONE matters in the census, regardless of citizenship status, and the data is used anonymously (by law, for 72 years). It cannot be used against you. Of course, it’s all more complicated than this, but this is the essence of what the census is and does. The only main goal is to get an accurate count so the government has updated info for making better decisions moving forward.

So anyway, I expect to probably vote for Warren. I’d rather not get into a fight about that here, but I should mention I’m not a Klobuchar supporter and haven’t followed her campaign too closely. 

But I have noticed in debates she likes to talk about being a prosecutor in Minnesota. I can only assume it’s to come off as relatable to voters. It’s a popular strategy right now, possibly because it worked for that guy who tweets a lot. But it’s exactly what everyone else is doing. 

Klobuchar’s unique strength is that she’s had 13 years in the Senate. Harris hasn’t finished her first term, Booker has had one (Klobuchar is beating him already), Buttigieg and Castro are mayors, Yang is a businessman, and Gabbard and O’Rourke are short-tenured Representatives. The only other candidates with comparable experience are *the top three.* Democrats don’t like inexperienced populists right now—who can blame them? 

And the top three though they are, they still consistently miss out on a third of voters. Biden’s history of somewhat authoritarian policymaking obviously turns off a good fraction of the electorate. And while Warren and Sanders have a strong following, their combined poll numbers never cross 50%. It seems like Democrats haven’t (yet) warmed to their rather ambitious agendas. 

If Klobuchar wants to appeal to Democrats, she needs to talk about being a Senator. She needs to be openly more experienced than the field. It’s her chance to stand out.",1

We most certainly know they will not. It’s always been the place of the party to take the high road, which is admirable but it’s not working. In the last couple of months I’ve noticed republicans doing this against each other. Knowing this means their base is susceptible to this kind of influence and that’s great. 

What is a Super PAC?

a type of independent political action committee which may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, and individuals but is not permitted to contribute to or coordinate directly with parties or candidates.
""in the 2010 congressional races, super PACs spent over $60 million""

This type of Organization could help with all of the individual and creative ideas attacking the hypocrisy of the GOP in the simplest of ways. 

Lindsey Graham backtracking on Trump

Mitch McConnell stopping of bills in the senate because they were only put through by Democrats. 

Jim Jordan knowing about the Sexual abuse at Ohio state.

Why does this family history (or, rather lack thereof) matter? Because it means that Trump has no personal experience to learn from and appreciate military sacrifice, and no authentic family history stories to share with the tens of millions of family members of proud Veterans, living and dead who served their country honorably in times of war during the past century.

I love Bernie Sanders and his platform. May be selfish, but Bernie is a the first candidate that I ever felt was fighting for something important to me and important for me.

I am a 24 year old girl in America. I’ve had a rough family history that’s included benefitting from wealth and currently struggling to not let poverty win. I started donating to Bernie’s campaign early this year and have kept up as well as I can. Currently my cell phone service is cut, and I don’t even have money to keep up with donations. This is pretty sad, considering I live with my mom and my younger sister, but everyone under the same roof is fighting the poverty debacle in their own way. I left my job for 10 months as a Starbucks barista due to toxic management that I didn’t feel confident voicing my concerns to. Work also made it difficult to keep up decently with schoolwork which has caused me to default on student loans for Southern New Hampshire University, and soon probably American Public.

I actually ended up in this situation because I left the comfort of my grandmothers wealth on account of having a baby, which she was not going to have if I stayed. Had I done what she wanted, my current baby boy would be the second baby I was forced to get rid of against my better judgement.

Anyway, I don’t mean to rant. But I’m in such a hole, I need help, and Bernie represents the only remaining hope I have for a better life for anyone. If anyone would like to help me out of my basic financial woes, though (I.e. the phone bill) that would be the most lovely thing this holiday season. Try not to report this for being in the incorrect category, but desperate times, man. 🤷🏾‍♀️",1

t3_eaxe2p,42,"Why Medicare for All? From FeeltheBern.org
There's a lot of disinformation out there about Bernie's Medicare for All Plan.  Here are some facts to help you counter the dishonest attacks on how the plan works.

#[Why Medicare for All?](https://feelthebern.org/operation-bern-the-turkey-2020/#tuesday)

Bernie believes access to medical care is a right not a privilege. If someone needs medical care they should be able to get it. No one should be afraid to see a doctor because they can’t afford to.

**Why is Medicare for All necessary? Why not expand the Affordable Care Act and create a public option?**

Our current system is a combination of employer-based insurance and private insurance – where profits rise as coverage decreases and claims are denied. Despite the promise that healthcare would become more affordable, that hasn’t happened. [The Affordable Care Act](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396), which made private insurance more accessible to more people, was a small victory, but healthcare and prescription drug costs have continued to soar — along with insurance company and pharmaceutical company profits. 

Premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs are far too high, and getting higher. Millions of Americans remain [uninsured](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18194228/trump-uninsured-rate-obamacare-medicaid) and [underinsured](https://fortune.com/2019/02/07/americans-health-care-underinsured-rate/). And not only is the coverage expensive, [it’s inadequate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/single-payer-cure-healthcare-reform). Most people must pay out-of-pocket for dental, vision, and hearing.  And people are fully aware that the healthcare system is broken. [70% of Americans](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/), including a majority of Republicans, now support Medicare For All.


**What is Bernie’s healthcare plan?**

Bernie believes that health care is a human right and the best way to ensure everyone is covered is a universal single-payer system, [Medicare for All](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18304712/read-bernie-sanders-2019-medicare-for-all-plan). Medicare already successfully delivers healthcare coverage for those over 65, nearly [15% of the U.S. population, around 44 million people](https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/health/fs149_medicare.pdf). Medicare for All would expand coverage, remove the profit motive, increase healthcare efficiency and make sure every single American is taken care of.

**This is how Medicare for All will be phased in:**

- In the first year the eligibility age for Medicare will be lowered to 55 and children under 18 will be covered

- The second year to 45

- The third year to 35

- The fourth year to everyone

- Anyone will be able to buy into Medicare for All during the transition.


**This is how Medicare for All will be paid for while reducing the overall cost of healthcare:**

- Personal payment of high premiums, co-pays, and deductibles to insurance companies will be eliminated

- Prices for healthcare services will be negotiated as they currently are for Medicare

- Prescription drug costs will be cut in half by negotiating prices (Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act), letting people buy low-cost prescription drugs from Canada (Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act), and capping prices to what the rest of the world pays (Prescription Drug Price Relief Act)

- Everyone will pay 4.5% on income and employers will pay 7.5% on employee income. For the first $29,000 of income there will be no tax


**This is how Medicare for All will change the current healthcare system and expand coverage:**

- Increase Access &amp; Choice: Patients can see the doctors they want because no doctors will be “out of network”

- Increase Coverage: Coverage will include primary and preventive care, mental health care, reproductive care, vision, hearing and dental care, medical devices, and long-term supports and services for the disabled and elderly.

- Improve Quality: Allows doctors to make decisions in the best interest of patients not to deliver profits to insurance companies.

- Reduce Prescription Drug Costs: Lowers prices dramatically, by empowering the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Prescription drug costs will be capped at $200.

- Eliminate Out-Of-Pocket Costs: There will be no premiums, deductibles or co-pays for any medical services.

- Empower People: Separates healthcare coverage from employment, so everyone will have flexibility to change jobs, or start their own business, without the risk and fear of losing their healthcare benefits.
Universal coverage: Covers everyone even if you get fired, leave your job, move, get divorced, turn 26, or have a pre-existing condition.

**What will it cost?**

Bernie’s plan is projected to cost $33 trillion over 10 years while expanding coverage and including everyone.

Last year total healthcare spending in the United States was $3.5 trillion. If we change nothing in this dysfunctional system the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsProjected.html) projects that healthcare in the U.S will cost at least $38 trillion over 10 years.

In 2018, [the average health insurance costs for a family of four was $28,166](http://ch.milliman.com/mmi/). That cost [increases $100 each month](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/06/06/health-care-costs-price-family-four/676046002/). Medicare for All will save most families $2000—$4000 per year. This [volunteer created tax calculator](http://www.bernietax.com/) will give you an idea of how Bernie’s plans will affect you.

**What are the ​expected savings?**

Medicare for All will drive down healthcare costs by using a schedule of payments for healthcare services like we already do for Medicare. There will be:

- Reduced overhead

- Lowered cost of prescription drugs

- Reduced administrative costs

- Consolidated private and public healthcare healthcare spending

- No more citizen spending on health insurance

- Increased bargaining power

Mercatus, a Koch-funded think-tank, conducted a study and found that Medicare For All would [save $2 trillion over a ten-year period](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). The University of Massachusetts Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) projected that the savings over the same period of time would be [approximately $5 trillion](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1127-economic-analysis-of-medicare-for-all).

**What are other benefits of Medicare for All?**

- Increase wellness and better health

- Increases financial stability for everyone

- [Reduces stress](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/health/policy/07medicaid.html) especially for those affected by serious diseases

- [Increases productivity and economic output of workers](https://www.nilc.org/issues/health-care/economic-impacts-of-increasing-access/).

Medicare for All will end the necessity for private health insurance because every citizen would be covered under a single payer system. And, it would save a lot of money – for workers, employers and the government. We can drastically reduce health care and prescription costs, we can cover more people, and we can make the coverage comprehensive. **It’s a win-win.**",1

How do you spread Bernie's message when you volunteer? According to the latest Emerson Poll, plurality of Iowa is in favor of public option, rather than M4A (even though Bernie is most trusted on the issue of Healthcare). So I think that any time you're texting, calling somebody or talk directly at somebody's house, you should tell them that Public Option is set up to fail and that its promise is completely fraudulent. It doesn't give anyone any freedom, but freedom to allow you to choose if they'll cut you your index finger or your ring finger. M4A actually saves money and gives the freedom to choose any doctor and any hospital you want, no matter your income.

I think that it wouldn't be bad if canvassers would tell the people they visit to help them to convince others. Like ""Please, we would really appreciate if you contribute to this campaign by convincing at least one or two friends, relatives or acquaintances to help Bernie too."" And remind everyone that this campaign won't get any help from MSM, because Bernie is honest politician who wants to help regular people not lobbyists, which is why nobody hears about him in the TV.

I would also try to calmly explain to everyone who's not on Bernie train, that if there was no Bernie, nobody in the primary would try to convince anyone he or she is progressive. Bernie popularized it. And that he's the only one not bought and paid for by anyone and is the only one who intends to really push his policies through.",1

I've watched identity politics battles, political activism, digital activism, silly trolls, apathetic mods, belligerent posters, cult flavored subs, and even gotten banned by only TWO subs.

One banned me because of where I posted as a lefty when they play the part of edgy liberals themselves.  The other plays gatekeeper to actual games instead of posting about it.  Pretty damn ironic...

t3_ear0z8,144,"Labour lost in the UK because they didn't support Brexit. This is an issue in the Bernie Sanders campaign as well, it boils down to immigration.
The working class in the UK is absolutely tired of competing with cheap Eastern block labor. They will do anything to stop it. If Corbyn would have supported Brexit he would have won. Instead the Tories were the only ones to offer that message. 

This sounds familiar, the people in working class jobs in the rust belt don't want to see more immigrants in their community competing with them for construction, manufacturing, and other industrial jobs. 

You can't call that racism, because it has nothing to do with the person's race or culture. It's purely a paycheck issue, it's the economy stupid. 

Neoliberals want to deny this so bad. They pretend as if economic anxiety played no role in Trump's election because everything is great for everyone. 

I think it's good that Bernie has said he doesn't support open borders because it's a Koch brothers policy. However, I think he needs to pivot further on this issue. If the job market is going to be THIS competitive even in prosperous cities, we really need to rethink having so many immigrants enter the country. 

Yes, I've seen the bullshit economic research that says immigrants only raise wages. They said the same thing about NAFTA, and every other bad deal. Now some are admitting they might have been wrong. No harm now, they already got their way. Economists are largely neoliberal ideologues posing as dispassionate observers.  I don't take them seriously, and it's not just me, the discipline itself has major credibility issues. That'll happen after continuing to ignore that the house is burning down because you're a few blocks away in a safe and well protected house.",1

I have always held the opinion that Bernie should have released all his medical records in Late October. The further away from Iowa the better. The problem with leaving it too late, is that the media will run with it. 

Medical records will contain finer details. This will allow the media to call up on ""medical experts"" to explain the findings to voters. I know most Bernie supporters will not buy into the spin that lie ahead. However there will be some who will. 

My hope is that Bernie's team emphasizes his cardiac echo results which should read, normal ejection fraction. Meaning his heart is pumping as well as the average person.  I have no reason to doubt that Bernie is in excellent health and has had more energy then what we saw in the begging of this campaign.

t3_eaao71,23,"Tulsi - It ends with me
If you haven’t read the [“Afghanistan Papers”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/) investigation published by The Washington Post this week, I recommend you do.  It exposes the betrayal and failed leadership of successive administrations. And points to the urgent need for a commander-in-chief who has the necessary experience, understanding, and foresight to bring about a sea change in our foreign policy.

After you read it, think about what the $4 billion in American taxpayer dollars spent every MONTH in Afghanistan has gotten us...

… And who has profited and continues to profit from this war,

… And all the troops who are still there,

… And all the families who have welcomed their wife, son, daughter, or husband back home at Dover Air Force Base, in a coffin draped in an American flag.

Do you feel betrayed? Lied to? You should. But it is not enough for us to feel frustrated or angry. We need to do something about it.

I’m calling on you to join me in ending once and for all the longstanding, failed foreign policy of carrying out regime change wars, overthrowing dictators we don’t like, and spending trillions rebuilding those foreign nations instead of our own. Will you stand with me?

This expose should be a wakeup call to our nation. It lays bare, in excruciating detail, the insanity of the foreign policy establishment:

The negligence of paper pushers in the Pentagon who saw billions of dollars flow past their desk with nothing to show for it and kept signing checks.
The greed of the military industrial complex that kept lapping up that money - our money - while America crumbled around them, with no shame.
The unimaginable hubris of leaders who thought they could invade a country that has been called the “Graveyard of Empires” with no clear objective or strategy, and prevail.
Ending this insanity is why I decided to run for president: To expose the lies of the Military Industrial Complex, to bring our troops home, to only send them to fight wars worthy of their great sacrifice, to lead us away from deadly, costly, counterproductive regime change wars and nation building and towards a future where we work hand in hand for peace, human dignity and true equality. To reinvest those TRILLIONS of dollars back here, at home, on the urgent needs of our people. 

I am the only candidate in this race who has been speaking truth to power about the rot in the military industrial complex. Nobody has been listening. Now the undeniable evidence is out — and I need your help to make sure it never gets swept under the rug again.

My personal commitment to you is that I will end these wars, and reinvest those trillions in taxpayer dollars back into the urgent needs of the American people. In housing, healthcare, education, green jobs and infrastructure and in our ailing communities. 

I will put an end to this insanity that has cost us so much. 

I hope you will join me.

t3_ea5w9c,39,"I’m not feeling very hopeful right now.
I haven’t for a while.  The recent news in the UK is just icing on the cake.


Let me start out by saying I’m not in a very good place in life right now.  For one thing, I have untreated depression.  Why is it untreated? I’m an American: do you even have to ask?  And yes, I know the whole song and dance about there being other resources available and all that, I’ve heard it a lot, but it hasn’t worked out for me yet in my experience.


In general, I’m a fairly negative and pessimistic person.  I realize that such an interpretation isn’t a perfect fit with reality either, but I’ve found it’s often closer than the opposite. Perhaps that’s confirmation bias; I recognize I’m no more immune to it than anyone else is, though I like to think I try to make an effort to change my beliefs when confronted with contradictory evidence.  I'm a millennial, and I've watched capitalism destroy things my whole life as the collective standard of living in my country decayed around me and that probably also colors my view.  I'm also mixed race, and while I've been fortunate in some regards not to have to deal with a lot of overt racism personally, I'm definitely very aware of its effects, and that probably also tints my perspective.  A lot of my opinion is shaped by what I see immediately around me—the news stories I take in, the people I interact with, and what’s happened in the past—put all together it dictates how I feel. My gut instinct you could say--that's really all this is about.


And it hasn’t been good.  I feel pretty much the same way I felt leading up to the 2016 primary: like we’re going to get fucked.  No matter how much I wanted to believe, I still predicted that Bernie wouldn’t be allowed to have the nomination, and that Hillary winning the primary would lead to a loss in the general.  I was told then I was being too pessimistic by the people I talk to, but you know how that turned out.  Someone I no longer talk to even blamed me for what happened after the fact as if I wished for it to happen… that was pretty surreal.


Unfortunately, I feel similarly this time as well. There’s two ways I really see it going:


1.	Bernie loses the primary.  Same crap we saw in 2016: mostly the media completely against him, and cheating by the establishment in counting the votes.  I don’t really see the campaign taking adequate steps against the latter at all: so far all I’ve heard is “we don’t think it will happen this time” which is not reassuring in the slightest.  As for the former, I generally think most people are actually really susceptible to propaganda and manipulation by the media.  I know faith in the institutions and major networks is at an all time low, but that shit still seeps into people’s consciousnesses. It’s the big lie: you repeat it enough and you can get plenty of people to believe it.  Case in point, Russia-gate: it’s complete nonsense, and while most Americans have bigger problems to worry about and it may not be high up on the list of things that are important to them, I think the vast majority DO still believe it, and it will color their opinions to an extent.  If you think it’s not an issue, look at how r/politics reacts to any mention of Tulsi Gabbard.  Sure, there are a lot of shills there, but the majority opinion is still way against her.  I like r/Wayofthebern, and it’s the only place I’ll willingly post, but I don’t exactly think it’s representative of the majority, sadly.


2.	Bernie actually wins the primary, but loses the general.  What? How is that possible? He destroys Trump in head to head matches.  Maybe, but in the general he will also have to be contending with an insurgency in the democratic party—the corporatists will still be doing everything in their power to see him fail, even while pretending to be on the same side.  I’m afraid the groundwork for that is already being laid, particularly with the impeachment bullshit.  Previously, Nancy Pelosi was against pushing it through, but what made her change her tune? When the establishment candidates de jour started to repeatedly flop and Bernie’s trend lines were looking up.  Add to that, they went with a completely asinine reason for doing it that no one in their right mind really cares about, as opposed to the far-worse shit he's guilty of.  The whole thing is deliberately timed to be as harmful to the democratic brand as possible and to rally Trump’s base around him.  And that’s just one of MANY questionable things the democratic leadership has done.  They’re deliberately sinking their own ship on the off-chance that Bernie might become its captain.
Another thing that worries me is the possibility of a corporatist spoiler third-party run.  That would never take off right? It might if it had the support of prominent democrats, peeling off just enough of the democratic coalition to throw the election to Trump.  On what grounds could they get away with not supporting the party’s nominee? Maybe if they have ‘serious concerns about the democratic party being co-opted by Russian influence’ or some crap like that. We know that Blue No Matter Who is for me and ye but not for they. Add to that the fact that the media will be on the corporatist’s side, and there’s real potential that they could do some damage.


I’ve been told before that I’m just being paranoid, and maybe I am.  I’ve also been told that the establishment and those arraigned against us are not that smart or competent and that it’s not some sixty-four-thousand dimensional chess move that they’re playing, and I can agree with that: Hillary’s loss to Trump after using the pied piper strategy is pretty much all the evidence you need.  However, I do think they have a sort of low cunning when it comes to dirty tricks in service of holding onto power with a vice-like grip, and a knack for dividing and conquering their enemies.  They are very quick to recognize threats to their power—something Bernie’s movement certainly represents—and will stop at nothing to eliminate those threats: perhaps even things that are better left unmentioned. 


Don’t misunderstand me: I voted for him and advocated for him when I could and intend to this election as well: just because I don’t necessarily believe it’s going to turn out well doesn’t mean I’m not going to try.  I’m not in a very good position to do much more than that at the moment myself, but please don’t think I’m trying to dissuade anyone from giving what support they can—I’m just worried by what I see.


I get worried when I see blanket statements along the lines of our victory being guaranteed.  I understand that optimism and hopeful statements are useful for bolstering people’s spirits—and maybe I need more of that, but that’s my problem—but I feel that it sometimes crosses the line into blind optimism, dismissing or ignoring something that is a genuine negative possibility.


I get worried when I see people touting positive polls but discounting negative ones as inaccurate and flawed in methodology.  Honestly, I tend to think that ALL the polls are flawed, both the negatives and the positive ones, and that in truth we are really flying blind.  It’s all meaningless crap used to push a narrative, and can potentially be wildly different than what will be the actual outcome.  For that matter, the actual outcome of the vote is questionable as well. Even if we had an accurate poll that showed our side far ahead, it doesn’t matter: because the establishment controls the vote counting.  Maybe we have a majority, but if each of our votes is tallied as counting for 3/5ths of theirs in the machines, well, we’re still probably going to lose.


I get worried when I see people arguing intractably about things like immigration, or nuclear power, or whether Cenk Ugyur is on the up and up.  I agree that there are certainly some policy positions that we shouldn’t compromise on, but to be completely inflexible and hostile to contradictory opinions is ALSO detrimental to the cause, and yes it can turn people off.  I hope I can acknowledge that without being accused of wanting to turn WotB into a safe space where people’s fee fees are protected at all costs.


I get worried when I see people being immediately hostile to newcomers and dismissing them as shills or concern trolls.  I’ve been lurking here since 2016, and post very seldom, but when I have that has actually happened to me.  It didn’t feel good to say the least, and it’s probably one of the reasons I don’t contribute more.  Hell, I’m worried the same will happen with this post.  Trolls and shills do exist and show up here pretty frequently, we’ve all seen it, but there also exist people that are genuine and can be won over. The sub is often accused of giving Sander’s supporters a bad image, and while I don’t think that could generally be further from the truth for the most part, I can see it sometimes.


I get worried when I see people saying they are turned off to Bernie and that Tulsi is the only one for them.  They’re few and far between, to be fair, but I have a couple people I talk to that feel that way.  I have nothing against Tulsi, I believe she is an ally, I admire her courage and integrity and willingness to do the right thing at great personal cost to herself.  I welcome favorable posts and news about her, and think she might actually still be working hand in hand with Bernie to tell the truth.  She’s on my shortlist for people I would want as VP, behind only Nina Turner who I adore.  At the same time, I don’t think she’s actually electorally viable.  That in itself is not a mark against her IMO—I voted green in 2016 after all—but it is a factor only in that Bernie IS electorally viable: he’s got a real shot, and needs as much support in the primary as he can get to make that happen.  One of the establishment’s goals is to pick off supporters around the edges with wedge issues, hoping to divide and conquer and make the movement suffer a sort of death by a thousand cuts… we shouldn’t make that easier for them. 


What’s my purpose in bringing up all these things? What do I propose be done about them?  I don’t know: I don’t have the answers.  I really wish I did.  That would be nice.  I'm not trying to tell anyone what they should be doing differently: to each their own, what works for someone might not work for someone else and vice versa. This is just my view. 


Sorry if all this just comes off and negative and depressing. Really, I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest.  That said, I generally think this sub is the best one on reddit, and it’s the only place I’ll willingly come out of my shell any—take that for what you will, I hope you see it as a credit.  I love all you guys, but… honestly my morale is kinda low right now.  I get that the establishment also wants us to be despondent and demoralized, and that I should strive to be the opposite out of spite, but all the gear grinding still takes its toll on me.  Trying to hang in there, but it’s not easy sometimes.

I am elevating my comment from the yesterday's [live thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/e9evuz/election_day_in_the_uk_results_exit_polls_start/) on the UK election, edited some for clarity, typos and over-the-top-ness. 

First, here is an addition: Look at this image and see the pattern.

https://twitter.com/election_data/status/1205371886856744961/photo/1

This is the reverse of what we also noticed in the 2016 primary with Bernie winning nearly ALL the rural areas, ALL the red states the small towns and most college precincts. That while Hillary won much of the metropolitan areas in addition to the southern states. In the general, the areas Bernie won went mostly for Trump (not surprising as the Dem voters there were in a decided minority), with Hillary making no inroads in the red states and losing nearly ALL rural and semi-rural areas. I.e., very similar to the picture this image indicates for the UK. This voter demographic must be born in mind, as we must not be carried away by the likely successes Bernie racks during the primary in areas that trend majority conservative. Which is a point I added to the original comment. 

Second, the **#youthquake** turned out to be a bubble. Instead we have a **#Brexitquake**, as people flocked to the polls to affirm the referendum for the leave position. Frankly I am not even sure all these young people voted labor.

By all accounts - George Gallaway's leading among them - Corbyn was boxed into the dominant ""let's remain somehow"" position of the Labor majority establishment. Actually he tried to straddle the divide with a wishy-washy ""let's do Brexit right"" and in the process leaned against the views of traditional labor supporters, who are working class and more often than not, pro-Brexit. He should have run on a ""let's do a smarter Brexit"" - with details - not waffle with some indeterminate either/or/may be. The voters of Britain wanted their majority vote respected, not dissed and not overturned.

There are some important takeaways here for Sanders and even more so, for the Sanders support camp:

1. Do not assume that just because you have many millenials on your side, you have them all. 

2. Do not assume that there will be enough millenials voting everywhere to make a really big difference. They may not have the numbers in many regions. And even where they do (as in College towns and big cities) they may not have the stamina and commitment of the boomers (ie, back when boomers were young, but lasting into this day). It's the boomers that still have the numbers, and they do vote - en mass. So cut out the OK Boomer crap already. That's only helpful if one wants to lose.

3. Beware of reading only what's written inside the Bernie bubble. The fact that there are many who support M4A does not mean there is a true cross-country support for that AS A MORAL POSITION. There isn't any such consensus, even if some want to see it writ large. What will win people over are pragmatic arguments. Example: Bernie is trying to flush out details of ""where the money will come from"" (and a good job he did on that too), but for the general (if he is the candidate) he will have to ditch the extension to illegals. This was never going to fly with anyone - not most Democrats and next to zero Republicans or independents. 


4. For the general, Bernie is going to have to modify and shoot down much of that ""Abolish ICE"" crap and perhaps move closer towards an ""Abolish FBI/CIA"" line, which IS what ALL Republicans and numerous independents will want to see come November 2020  Right now, before us is a spectacle of a deeply politicized and badly compromised intelligence community. We saw some of them reflected in the impeachment circus. And the Horowitz report, despite whatever one line Dem propaganda managed to rescue from it, was beyond damning, if one looks at the substance. Indeed, with all the details coming out about the totally corrupted FISA process, which then begets the Russiagate hoax, Bernie will have to leave himself some room to maneuver out of the box the Dems put themselves in.  How to do that will be a challenge, because the primary places one set of pressure points which then will need to be almost reversed for the general.  


5. We may not have the Brexit dilemma but we do have the impeachment dilemma. The democrats just scored an own goal. No, this was not Bernie's doing but it'll taint him by association. To navigate this Polosi/Schiff/MadDems - induced quagmire will require a very smart strategy.  I can only hope he has very good advisors.

6. Many other lessons will be drawn but in the end of the day we have to process the possibility that the electorate - whatever it is made of - is not as ready for socialist/people-oriented reforms as we think (and sometimes assume) they are. Most people are neither brave, nor far sighted. People tend to vote for their immediate bread-and-butter concerns. Only a small subset votes with their own preferred ideology. And no, the vast majority of the people WILL NOT spend time educating themselves about what's really good for them.                                         Worse yet, the human is, fundamentally, still a primitive selfish beast (no insult to real beasts intended). In Britain they wanted out of an EU partly because they feared an EU that will try and ram endless streams of migrants down their throats and putting pressure on working class people's wages and cultural mores,  while threatening UK's independence of action as a sovereign nation. Most Americans also view too much illegal immigration as a net negative (no one has a problem with ""a little""), just as they view the crazy #Metoo rope-a-dope overboard and all the rest of the PC stuff. People will not change just because we want them to. So, best to keep  in mind that during the general election, a Bernie candidate will encounter a very strong anti-illegal border crossing sentiment. As well as a strong anti PC sentiment. This within some of the very voter groups he will need to carry.

7. Corbyn's policy proposals were far reaching in taking on the austerity driven neoliberal economic direction the country's economic elites - and the EU technocrats - seem inclined to push. This however IS NOT an easy pill to swallow for voters in more conservative parts of the country - as the image above indicates. many people simply did not want to 'rock the boat"". Whatever their motives for rejecting Corbyn's policies (and yes, this WAS a rejection!) and however much people are wrong in doing so, in the end humans are a fearful lot. The very word ""conservative"" implies an outlook of ""let's not change things too much or too fast because they may get worse before they get better"". This is the hurdle Bernie will also face if he is the candidate in the general (and possibly during the primary to some extent). People out there do not all know what we do, they have not read and seen what we did, so it's also a lesson for us, Bernie's supporters.

I also wanted to draw attention to this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/e9yy2k/uk_election_takeaways_for_berners_all/) which brought in yet a few more lessons worth studying.",1

UK election takeaways for Berners &amp; all Anti-Trumpers **(please add to list):**

A.	For Berners: 

1.	**Lesson: MSM will remain unified** and relentless, on the need to keep out of high office any Bernie-type figure, regardless of how bad the personality or policies of the alternative, or any other disagreements among MSM factions.

2.	**To-Do: Never stop calling out MSM** -- perhaps to the point of prefacing most responses to MSM questions with **“That is a dishonest question, serving the self-interest of the corporations who pay your salary, and whose biggest fear is that uncovering truth will empower poor and middle class voters.  The truth is that …”**


B.	For all anti-Trump stakeholders: 

1.	**Lesson:** The latest example of **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** is that **“Respect my prior vote”** (especially with nationalist and/or tribalist flavor) can easily become such a dominant issue for swing-voters that, although ‘merely’ a psychological interest, it overrides all other psychological and tangible interests.

2.	**To-Do:** Don’t under-estimate the power of Trump’s message that **“Deep State interference with the voters’ 2016 choice** is the common theme of anti-Trump surveillance, fake news leaks, investigations, Blob fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian, and impeachment to cover-up corruption of Joe and Hunter Biden.”

Shorter: **What part of “fuck you for not giving me change” did you not understand?**

P.S.

Another cross-post: from us/bout_that_action https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/e9zkee/ben_norton_lesson_from_uk_election_is_not_labour/: 
&gt;[**Lesson:**] Neoliberal Blarities sabotaged Corbyn from day 1. He never took authoritative control of [the] Labour [Party]; it was dominated by centrists who waged war against him, socialists, and working-class policies

**To-do:** The equivalent strategic decision for Presidential nominee Bernie will be in selecting a Vice Presidential running mate:

1. No number of concessions to party machine careerist holdovers will result in any genuine cooperation from them -- or even from a centrist VP nominee, in light of the 2000 election in which centrist Al Gore could not even rely on the loyalty of more-centrist Joe Lieberman.

2. Traditional ticket balancing (notably of gender, race, ethnicity, geography and even religion and age) must be subordinated to **Bernie's, and the electorate's, ability to trust the VP nominee's commitment and capability** to promote and pursue Bernie's core policies and message.

3. The only logic that might possibly prevail over the above is if the only way for Bernie to obtain the nomination turns out to be promising the VP spot to, say, Warren, in return for Warren delivering to Bernie her own pledged convention delegates. But, in light of how easily a hobbled ticket can become a 'poisoned chalice,' if Bernie holds a plurality of pledged delegates, Bernie's best posture in ticket horse-trading is probably:

&gt;'I make no promises except that, **if I am nominated, I will win and, if I am not nominated, you will lose.**'",1

I am sick and tired of seeing so many neoliberals jump to social media to justify a UK election as a reason to warn against Bernie and progressives. They are lying and unfortunately many of you have failed to grasp the UK political climate. I will explain. 

*  Labour party has historically relied an the so called ""red wall"". Stretching from Wales to norther England. These voters usually always vote labour, but in 2016 the majority voted to leave the EU. 
* In 2017, Corbyn and his party promised to uphold the results of the 2016 EU referendum. The UK parliament has been in dead lock for 3 years. Public became tired, many angry and disenfranchised. During this period the conservative party promised to end this deadlock. To ""get brexit done"". This phrase was plastered everywhere. On every corner of the media.  
* Corbyn has seen the highest unfavourable ratings in Labour history. You can point towards media bias but it does not change the fact that people dislike him. 
* Conservatives promised to increase day-to-day public service spending by £34 billion, or almost 10%, between 2019-20 and 2023-24. That in itself was a huge shift by a conservative party.
* Conservatives message of getting brexit done resonated throughout labour heartland. These labour voters cared about the health service and welfare state. However they believed that getting brexit done was the most important issue. The need to break the political deadlock. 
* Polls showed that majority of people were willing to increase taxes to fund public health services. Voters wanted honesty and Labour failed to bring that. They promised to tax only the 95% of highest earners. Those making about 80k a year. This was not a wealth tax and they were wrong to say that those earning less would not pay more. There was dishonesty from both sides. Ofcourse more from the conservatives 
* In the end the Labour red wall collapsed. The number one issue for voters in all polls was Brexit. There is no denying that a deeply unpopular labour leader also contributed to this disastrous result.

I did not write this but it’s a great post to use as a resource...is crediting the OP allowed or will that get the post removed?

——————

Bernie is the only 2020 candidate who [cautioned us about the war in Iraq,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om-x323Em0) and he was absolutely right.
 
He also [raised awareness of the dangers of climate change more than 30 years ago,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj8-D1flRdg) and he was absolutely right again.
 
In fact, [his message has been *incredibly* consistent for decades.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RU3NKvvxcSs)
 
He has demonstrated that he will do the right thing and fight for people, whether it's easy or hard. From [protesting segregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTZgerssSrU) to [fighting for LGBT rights,](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fARW2YwerTc) he was on the right side even when everyone warned him that it could end his political career. He has shown that he genuinely cares about people and he has shown that he will stand on his principles. There's no other candidate who has a record like him and there's no other candidate who deserves our trust as much as he does. Bernie has been fighting for us every day of his life since before most of us were born, and [he has a long list of accomplishments.](https://twitter.com/GunnelsWarren/status/1147713369127956481)
 
The fact that he's such a good candidate makes it even more upsetting that [the media constantly makes baseless attacks on his character,](https://youtu.be/3ZhkKATtqtU) or [omits him from coverage altogether.](https://imgur.com/a/VyNVA8D) Someone put the data together recently and [the news mentions Biden *four times* as much as Bernie](https://i.redd.it/8zgsck6p39041.jpg) despite similar polling numbers. They also mention Warren more than twice as much and they even mention Buttigieg more often despite the fact that he's polling in single digits. Mainstream media is giving him such bad coverage that [Fox News viewers are more likely to support Bernie than MSNBC viewers are.](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-viewers-more-likely-to-support-bernie-sanders-than-msnbcs-2019-5) There's actually a great wikipedia page that provides [lots of information about media bias,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias_against_Bernie_Sanders) and there's also a great subreddit called r/BernieBlindness.
 
It's pretty clear, the establishment is trying to rig this election [just like the last one.](https://www.salon.com/2016/03/30/10_ways_the_democratic_primary_has_been_rigged_from_the_start_partner/) So of course they'll do their best to downplay the fact that [Bernie has the most supporters by far,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html) he's [surging in the polls](https://bernie.substack.com/p/bern-notice-the-bernie-surge-and) and he has [overwhelming support amongst young voters.](https://i.redd.it/ybarwig9v5u31.jpg) And they're *definitely* not going to tell you that [a recent Emerson poll found that Bernie is the *only* candidate beating Trump in a nationwide head-to-head.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFnQrCVBFBc)
 
The [other candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive) just [don't stack up.](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/22/pete-buttigieg-just-shill-corporations-and-donor-class)
 
If anyone wants to learn more about Bernie I would recommend watching [a speech](https://youtu.be/jYBKZ7DPkkQ?t=2901) or [an interview,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng) and I'd definitely suggest that you [read his campaign plans.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/) I'd also recommend checking out the Bernie subreddits, r/SandersForPresident, r/WayOfTheBern and r/OurPresident, as well as r/MobilizedMinds.
 
The media won't give Bernie fair coverage, so we have to. Support Bernie in any way you can, and get the word out as much as possible. Let people know that the media is covering him up, and tell them who he really is. Get people registered to vote and remind them to vote in the primaries. If we all work together we can do this!

*Exit Polls will also be released at that time and will be posted here.*

Here's some info to help get ready:  650 Seats in the House of Commons are up for votes.  326 votes to make a Majority Government.

Currently, Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party hold 298 seats PLUS 10 seats from the DUP (conservatives from Northern Ireland.)  The DUP says it will NOT support Boris and the Tories any more, so Boris will need to get that 326 on his own.

Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, now holds 243 seats.  The SNP has 35, Plaid Cymru (Progressive Welsh Praty) holds 4 seats, the Green have 1 and Independents have 5.  288 right now.

In addition the Liberal Dems  a/k/a ""Tory-lite or FibDems hold 21 seats.  (That number is predicted to shrink by half or more.)  And the Sinn Fein from NI hold 7 seats but up until now haven't stood with any Party.  I'm not sure they even come to Westminster at all.  2 seats are vacant.

I'll check back here all day tomorrow and will be happy to discuss turnout or anything else with anybody who is interested.

First of all, you could tell me how do these videos carry any weight, because MSM won't tell the public about them, so I don't know how exactly they get to the people. These endorsement videos though, if promoted correctly, would help maybe even more than any previous one.

1. Ariana Grande of course, because she's crazy rich, which means something if you support ""socialist"". And of course, because she's crazy popular.

2. Noam Chomsky, because she's Mega famous scientist and a thinker of silent generation, it could trigger other big famous thinkers to do the same.

3. Ben and Jerry, because they would show and finally prove that Bernie isn't against private ownership and that even wealthy capitalists can support him.

4. This one is crucial and extremely important and I definitely hope that she would support Bernie and not some corporatist... Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Because America can't afford another Brett Kavanaugh on the SCOTUS bench and she's already basically walking corpse who can drop dead any day, her endorsement would shoot Bernie's support to the stars, because since all liberals are worried about her and Roe v Wade dying, everybody would realize how formidable would Bernie be against Trump and that he's the only one who could beat him.

I've explained to him that Sander's tax plan actually lowers many middle-class tax brackets (as I recall from his 2016 tax plan) but he clings to played out Republican talking points about socialism etc.

But on the other hand, he resents the fact that the richest Americans have SO MUCH wealth while so many others struggle too hard for too little. He still manages to simultaneously believe that, and also that in America anyone can succeed if they just work hard.

I can see it in this guy, he is really a Bernie supporter, he just doesn't know it. Despite how much he's been brainwashed by conservative media, he sounds remarkably like Sen. Sanders himself a lot of the time he talks about issues like inequality and corruption.

What would be the right way of getting him around? What video clips, or statistics should I show him? What should my general plan of attack be so he's open to hear me out? Thank you Reddit! There's hope for this one yet!


P.S. I don't know if I should focus too much on disparaging Trump, but I think he still has to see that he's made the ""swamp"" worse, and has failed many other campaign promises.",1

I think that besides for Bernie, canvassers should also raise awareness of Berniecrats running for Congress. There's about 200 of them right now (although that's questionable wheter all are genuine, but congress with progressives would still be better than genuine anti-progressives) and about 15 of them for senate, 14 of them in deep red states.

I think that in order to massively stomp the republican party to the ground forever and save the world from them, for good, we should also work to massively turn the congress blue with genuine populists.

I'm mostly worried about the senate candidates, because turning the senate blue would be the most helpful to the world. Especially Kimberly Graham (IA), Betsy Sweet (ME), Ted Terry (GA) and especially Sema Hernandez from Texas, because Texas is Super Tuesday state and the primaries for the senate are also on March 3rd. Sema is really struggling to raise enough money and the frontrunner is MJ Hegar who's (let me remind you female, which makes it even worse for me) veteran against peace and against M4A. She already raised over 2M of big donations and sema only a few thousand. She could really use for some help of Bernie, AOC and others.

2) The good timeline--Sneaky Peter continues to drop like a rock (because people see through his slick car salesmen person) and Bernie takes 2-3 of the first four states.  California will look nice (thank you, volunteers!) and then Biden only saving grace (herp derp, best to beat Trump) falls apart.

So I see Amy Klobuchar has moved from 1% to 10% in the latest Emerson poll, while Warren has fallen by 11%.

Someone suggested these were ""But Sanders isn't a real Democrat"" voters. While my first thought is *whatever*, it occurs to me that there's an opportunity here with Klobuchar to take a stab at neutralizing the inevitable ""But he's not a real Democrat"" argument.

Okay, so with Klobuchar's recent ""surge,"" no doubt brought on by a combination of a pliant media, the NeverBernie crowd looking for a savior, and a smattering of First Woman President I Don't Care Who voters, we'll undoubtedly see the ""Bernie's not a real Democrat"" played up in the absence of trying to paint Klobuchar as ""just like Bernie.""

So we need to start pointing out, proactively, often, and loudly, that **KLOBUCHAR ISN'T A REAL DEMOCRAT!**

Because she's **not**, as MN doesn't actually have a Democratic party, we have the DFL party (Democrat/Farmer/Labor). And like Bernie, Klobuchar *caucuses* with congressional Dems.

(Footnote, NE also doesn't have a ""Democratic Party"" and Ben Nelson isn't a ""real Democrat"" either, he only caucuses with them nationally)

The response will be, ""But the DFL is the same,"" but this only ads volume to the argument that she's not actually a ""Democrat"" - just like Bernie - but no one cares.

Klobuchar's rise and subsequent attention is the perfect chance to neuter the ""Not a real Democrat"" spreading ""But she's not a real Democrat"" and getting this into the discussion.",1

So the idea is that only poor people conspire.  

""Conspiracies"" are prosecuted in the courts every day.   The courts will throw the hammer down on two or more poor dudes who get together and try to rob a liquor store or whatever.  

But the idea that two or more *rich* people may get together and conspire is *crazy conspiracy theory* -- even though it also happens every day (though admittedly the powers-that-be will often simply legalize their would-be-conspiracies).   

We have literally tens of thousands of documents from eg the CIA alone demonstrating conspiracy after conspiracy after conspiracy.   Illegal activities that are far more serious than two dudes robbing a liquor store; I'm talking about overthrowing governments, torture, genocide, you name it.  

The widespread usage of the term ""conspiracy theory"" must be regarded as one of the most remarkable and successful propaganda feats in human history.   Even more remarkable is that the academics who roll their eyes about ""conspiracy theories"" fully acknowledge that these conspiracies were ubiquitous until very recently.   So yeah, sure, CIA drug trafficking, Iran Contra, Iraq lies, some will even admit that James Earl Ray was obviously a patsy, but elites conspired to do something recently?  THAT'S UNPOSSIBLE.

I understand the answer may be different for a lot of you so please feel free to chime in.

t3_e8yqxm,166,"So now there's a new theory as to why voters would choose Anti-Establishment candidates over perfectly acceptable corporate stooges in elections, ""Chaos Voter Theory""
&gt;This new Chaos Voter Theory is quickly hardening into conventional wisdom in the American political discourse, its findings deemed essential to understanding the motivations of Trump voters. The paper has been written up on The New York Times op-ed page, covered in detail by Esquire and New York Magazine, referenced by The Washington Post and Slate, cited as both vindication for the Democratic Party establishment and evidence of its intellectual bankruptcy. 

&gt;The sudden attention to the Chaos Voter is not an obtuse academic exercise; it has the potential to reshuffle the way Democrats understand “electability” heading into 2020 ― the fuzzy concept that party faithful overwhelmingly cite as their overriding priority in the primary. But the underlying study is both deeply flawed and easy to misinterpret ― offering as many lessons about Democratic voters as it does about Trump’s supporters.

&gt;That’s in part because the study isn’t explicitly about President Trump or Trump voters at all. Three political scientists ― two from Denmark’s Aarhus University and one from Temple University in Philadelphia ― collaborated to examine the spread of “hostile political rumors” over social media in both countries. These included anything from cuckoo-bananas conspiracy theories to a feverish emphasis on real political scandals. All told, they surveyed more than 5,000 Americans and over 1,300 Danes.

&gt;They discovered that people who share these things don’t really care if they’re true. Posting them is instead an act of political defiance directed broadly at “elites,” and the chief motivation is not to illuminate the masses but to damage those overlords. Critically, this defiance is generally not partisan in any conventional sense. People who share a lot of hostile rumors target Republicans and Democrats alike, and they don’t really care which parties or candidates end up reaping political benefits. The researchers also found a strong correlation between those who share hostile political rumors and those who support what they call “violent activism” (more on this deeply misleading label later) and a “Need for Chaos.”

&gt;How did researchers figure this out? By asking people whether they agreed with eight apocalyptic statements: 

&gt;&gt;    “I get a kick when natural disasters strike in foreign countries” 

&gt;&gt;    “I fantasize about a natural disaster wiping out most of humanity such that a small group of people can start all over”  

&gt;&gt;    “I need chaos around me ― it is too boring if nothing is going on”

&gt;&gt;    “Sometimes I just feel like destroying beautiful things”

&gt;&gt;    “There is no right and wrong in the world” 

&gt;&gt;    “I think society should be burned to the ground” 

&gt;&gt;    “When I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking “just let them all burn” 

&gt;&gt;    “We cannot fix the problems in our social institutions, we need to tear them down and start over.”

&gt;The more out-there the statement, the fewer respondents agreed. But endorsing these ideas was closely associated with sharing hostile political rumors on social media.

&gt;All of this makes intuitive sense. People who spread conspiracy theories on Facebook are probably going to be more likely to say wacky things to academic researchers. But the study’s most startling conclusions aren’t about the lunatic fringe. According to the study, 40% of Americans are sympathetic to the expressions about letting political institutions “all burn” and to “tear them down and start over.”

Spread The Word:

I'm here with a list of candidates to raise attention on their races. I'm only here to help. If this is wrong in anyway to post, I apologize. So, don't only support Bernie Sanders. It'll help if we elect people like him to the two chambers of Congress. I've managed to gather a group of progressives we can help get into Congress. I'll also be adding open seats in case there is interest in the progressive movement to get a candidate to run for that race. Let's support these other progressives for House &amp; Senate as well if you can:

He is attempting a primary challenge against Mike Espy, a standard corporate liberal with millions of dollars at his disposal.  Mike Espy already got the nomination against Cindy Hyde-Smith in 2018  and lost by over 7 points despite the controversy of her then recent  “public hanging” remark. In addition to this, we saw conservative  Democrat Jim Hood lose the Governorship  last month by over 6 points. This should be enough to tell us that  corporate Democrats cannot win Mississippi, and that Espy will lose again if he gets the nomination again.

The problem is that Jensen is not in the best place right now  financially, and if he doesn’t get enough support by the filing deadline of January 10th, he won’t be able to pay the $1,000 filing fee that is required for Senate candidates in Mississippi. So it would be immensely appreciate if any of you could  send a few bucks his way or at the very least share this post. It’s  important that we do our best to help our progressive allies take down  the system, otherwise nothing will change and we will have six more  years of Miss “Public Hanging” to look forward to.",1

The following message is a part of our 2020 Presidential Candidate Series. For more information, see below.
The future doesn’t belong to Trump and his billionaire friends, Al. It belongs to all of us.
But beating Trump and electing a government that works for everyone and not just the wealthy few will require an unprecedented grassroots movement made up of people from all backgrounds and from every community in this country.
And that starts with you.
That is why I am asking you to make a contribution -- right now -- to the DNC’s Democratic Unity Fund.
The DNC is already working hard to build a strong operation that will not only help to defeat Trump, but to elect progressives at every level of government. But they cannot do this alone. No one person and no one organization can.
There is only one way, and that is together. So, I am asking:
Make a $3 contribution that will be split between my campaign and the Democratic Unity Fund. Your contribution, of any amount you can afford, will help build the vital infrastructure that Democrats and progressives need to win across the map in 2020.

Of course in this election, we must not only defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous and corrupt president in modern American history…
We must also transform this country.
We must elect a government that has the courage to stand up to Wall Street, the drug companies, and the fossil fuel companies.
And that is why we must not just elect a Democrat to the White House in 2020 -- we must elect Democrats and progressives in every community from the top of the ticket all the way to the last race on the ballot.
That is why I am counting on your support today.
It’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure the Democratic Unity Fund is strong enough, which is why I wanted to ask you to make your first contribution to the fund today.
Please donate $3 to my campaign and the Democratic Unity Fund. No single candidate for president, not even the greatest candidate you can imagine, can beat Donald Trump alone.
In solidarity,
Bernie Sanders
P.S. Donald Trump's campaign and the RNC have been able to get off to a fast start this election. They are both raising obscene amounts of money. If we stand together, not only are we going to defeat them in 2020, but we are going to transform this country. That is why I am asking: Will you split a $3 donation between my campaign and the Democratic Unity Fund today?",1

t3_drw8ly,187,"CALL TO ACTION: You need to VOTE in the November 5th election. This year's elections will determine how well republicans can use voter suppression tactics and gerrymander in the 2020 race
[27 states](https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_calendar) are having elections tomorrow, on **November 5th**.

The massive turnout in 2018 resulted in numerous Democrats getting elected to local, state, and federal seats - the blue wave was real. These gains have had obvious impacts from the ability to impeach the president, to the number of bills passed in the house, and allowing state Democrats to prevent voter suppression tactics and gerrymandering.

The **MOST** impactful action you can take is to vote in every election, regardless of how competitive it is. Voting once increases the chance of voting again; furthermore, the better Democrats do in elections provides momentum to attempt again the next cycle. **With so many disenfranchised voters supporting democrats, it is incredibly important for us to help Democrats get elected to state legislatures - so they can reduce barriers to voting.**

**Links to resources that will prepare you to vote tomorrow and provide any needed information.** I highly recommend reading the links in order

1. [Check if you have an election coming up](https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_calendar)
2. [Check your registration](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/)
3. [Register to vote](https://www.vote.org/register-to-vote/)
4. [Find your nearest polling place](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)
5. [Get an absentee ballot](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/)
6. [Sign up for text &amp; email election reminders](https://www.vote.org/election-reminders/)
7. [Watch a YouTube video that explains the voting process in your state](https://www.youtube.com/c/howtovoteineverystate)
8. [Find volunteering opportunities on Mobilize.us](https://www.mobilize.us/)
9. Donate on [Act Blue](https://secure.actblue.com/) to Democrats in elections and organizations like [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/) and [League of Conservation Voters](https://www.lcv.org/)

**Tips to improve your voting experience and increase your impact.**

* Figure out how you are getting to polling place.
   * Making a plan and making sure you have a ride to the polling place greatly increases voter turnout.
* Go to the polls as early as you can
   * Lines to vote get longer throughout the day, by going early you can help reduce congestion.
* Bring friends and family with you
* Post a picture of you with an ""I Voted"" sticker on all of your social media
* Share these resources with your network",1

Back in the 2015 primaries the Bernie Bros caused many major issues.

They spread fake news and blatant lies about Hillary. They used sexist, concern troll arguments to try and discredit Hillary because they couldn't stand the thought of a Woman President. They bought in to every smear that Bernie published while admonishing Hillary any time she tried to defend herself. They supported Bernie WAY too far into the primary process and forced Hillary to waste massive amounts of time and effort that would have been better spent against the orange fuck.

Worst of all, after Hillary won the primary nomination the vast majority of berners still REFUSED to fall in line and support our rightfully elected candidate. They either submitted a protest vote by writing in Bernie in the general election, or submitted a spite vote for the orange fuck.

I'm afraid that when it becomes clear that Elizabeth Warren is the frontrunner for the 2020 election, the bernie bros will fall back to their same dirty tricks. Just looking at the Sanders support subreddit you can already see they are scheming up ways to make Warren look bad and to shame anyone who supports her.

So my question is ***what have we learned from the 2015 nominations about Bernie Bros and the issues inherent to them that we can use in 2019 to try and reduce the damage they will cause to Elizabeth Warren?***",1

It made me smile for two reasons: 

1. The car occupants are from TEXAS! A state more purple than red in 2016 and which may actually turn blue next election.

Obviously she's not going to come out and endorse anyone during the primaries because she's too classy to create that kind of rift in the party but based on her work since the last elections I would guess that she would be leaning towards someone like Warren, Kamala or Booker. 

Many people would disagree about Warren but I think there are a lot of similarities... they are both meticulous and have detailed plans and policies. I think Hillary actually opened up the way for Warren to run the way she is doing.

And ideologically, she is most similar to Kamala and Booker. Kamala more so. 

People keep lumping her in with Biden but he's far more conservative than she is especially on identity politics; He's riding on Obama whereas she didn't have to in that sense.

If biden had run in 2016 I think we'd have seen something similar to the Kamala/Biden show down in this debate. In retrospect I kinda wish he had because she wouldn't have been left with the dullards and Bernie in 2016.

I think it's an important question to consider because as usual people discount Hillary supporters like they weren't part of the majority and also ignore the progressive work Hillary has been doing behind the scenes since the elections.",1

I've seen Hillary make multiple comments with a favorable view of Kamala Harris along with many of her campaign staffers jumping to Kamala's campaign. Why do you think they are doing this rather than jumping to Biden who Hillary has more experience with?

I personally support Kamala but am genuinely curious why she has gotten more help from Hillary's people than Biden. Maybe this will change when Biden begins his campaign but I was also wondering if there's any ill will between her and Biden.

Since Warren has declared, we can assume the others will follow soon and I'm curious about who Hillary supporters are backing this time.

Frankly I have to say that the potential field of Democrats vying for the candidacy in 2020 seems far more exciting and dynamic than the one in 2016 (apart from Hillary). I mean in 2016, Hillary's primary opposition was 5 aging white men, who either ran bland campaigns or resorted to smearing her to get ahead. 

But looking to 2020, the potential field looks more promising. Warren, Harris, Booker, Klobuchar, Gillebrand, Brown, Castro, Beto, Abrams? This is a world apart. And they're ALL strong personalities, with strong policy ideas (not too different from each other). My hope is that they learn from 2016 and campaign on policy and refrain from personal smears and false innuendo against each other. 

 We know Hillary won't run but she holds the support of the majority, especially within the Democrats, even if they are silent.  The silent majority will make the difference here again.

Personally, I think it will be more about the team than the individual... I like Kamala but she will need a strong running mate - maybe Beto or Brown. I only say Beto because he would give a realistic chance of winning Texas and if that happens then Dems dont have to rely on Florida.

But I'm curious to hear what other Hillary supporters on this sub think and who they prefer.",1

And I say what's on the title just to be certain: It's all and well deserved that Trump should win the 2016 election, and I hope there would be no protest to my words, but it's actually true. He racked up the most promises and the trusts he was able to obtain from people who were looking forward of so much from the man who was a political figurehead, though not practicing himself in the political scene, and eventually a President of the United States.

His own attitudes however, stains the presidency and it doesn't do him good at all.

If it ever results to someone such as him to use foreign power to investigate a future political rival in an upcoming election, that deserves to be called by itself ""suspicious"" so as to ruin how diplomacy is exchanged. This was never a form of diplomacy. This was bribery, as Zelensky only wanted to get a visit to the White House. Sure he got his aid, but the White House visit was suspended. Rightly so, because the aid he received was in exchange of an inexcusable action, an action WHICH WAS NEVER COUNTERED IN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM THE HEARINGS. And now Reps keep defending Trump in spite of having no evidence to fully counter when there were witnesses and a core transcript that tells completely differently. The Dems actually did what was actually obvious. Although in some cases they could be called the starters of a political stunt, it's still the right thing to do: No president is above the law, and it's a crime by itself to bribe a foreign leader. Impeachable at its core, and something to stain a former president when he/she is off the chair.

So I implore the rest of you in this subreddit to start getting momentum. As the debates are ongoing and, with Republicans losing the fight repeatedly, and though I'm not capable, I propose a rally against Trump. He keeps holding up these rallies to get him support on the reelection plan he's got. That should have been the main focus instead of ruining the reputation of the Bidens in Ukraine. That was his mistake. I say there should multiple rallies expressing things against Trump who at all has a very disgusting attitude problem.

Reps think history would think on these events of impeachment? In the long term, they'll also suffer this as well, though Democrats will pay that bill immediately. It won't be as devastating as the Republicans would receive it. Who agrees? :)",1

These two links are very simple and can give you the direct number to their office.

It honestly took 3 min of my time to call let them know my opinion on a particular stance and then be on way with my day. And yes I know that 1 call won't make a difference but there are millions of people on Reddit and if even 1% started calling it could really sway some opinions. 

Now a lot of the repsonses i expect to get from this post will be along the lines in ""they will only do what their donors want"" or something along those lines lines. And yes this is true, but that's because they aren't receiving a lot of calls or messages telling them other wise. There is no doubt corruption and bad politicians but there are some good ones that truly believe they serve the people. Furthermore they know the people who call are far more likely to go to the polls, and even if they are a shitty politician,they know they have to get re-elected.

It would have been 2005-2007 a display ad in the NY Post, some discount furniture retail proprietor took it upon himself to share his tale of the Gumpian largesse of Fred Trump.  Poor guy's mom didn't have the rent when Fred and son number two came around to collect.  Playing catch with a football with then teenage Donald was fondly recalled, meanwhile Fred was inside working out a deal with mom.  He let her take her time to repay what she owed and gave her $100 too.  The story wrapped up with this episode attributing it as formative to the kid's future success, and a heartfelt, "" god bless you Donald Trump and your father in heaven.""

I would love to have proof of this ad's existence in my possession.  I recall feeling that the story was not so much an example of great charity, as it was a weird celebrity worship.  The Trump reality show was on, and he had been covered regularly by the Post for many years, also to excess in my opinion.

Now that there are so many reports about Trump's unceasingly needy and fragile ego, I wonder if a certain Mr. Baron conceived of this advertisement, and called in a favor.  I probably forget some copy from that ad which could provide context, not to mention knowing the actual date of publication and what other news coverage that could have triggered Donald was circulating at the time.

This cult of personality goes further back than most people think, and I want to improve on that inaccurate notion by considering the followers, not their idol, but definitely including the inner circle.",1

[Punishment Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KXLmSd1oUQ) (1971)


Trump's dictatorial ambitions are well known and obvious. This alternative history film takes us back to 1970, at the height of protest against the Vietnam War and the culmination of the 1960s wave of radicalism before it entered on its decline. The President was Richard Nixon, a foul mouthed, crude non-entity almost 10% as crooked as the present Thief-in-Chief. Which is very bad.


The basic plot is that President Nixon, in the face of growing revolt at home and military stalemate abroad has decided to declare a state of emergency. People are swept up in the dragnet, and the jails rapidly overfill with political prisoners. I presume that non-political prisoners are also released in droves to make space. After all, what's a minor indiscretion such as murder compared with the horrendous crime of disagreeing with the President. Sound familiar in these days when the Great Baby says that his critics are traitors and that they should be executed ?


As the jails fill it becomes harder and harder to stack the prisoners one above the other. The ever crafty Administration comes up with an 'alternative'. Spend your sentence in jail or see if you can make it 53 miles across a California desert (presumably Death Valley) without food or water while being pursued by the military and police. For the pursuers this is part of their training. You have three days to reach the finish line where you supposedly get your -get-out-of-jail-free card. But there is a catch. 


The film is in English with Spanish subtitles.",1

On the 2020 elections.

Is Trump the right man for the country? I say no and offer the following.

I invite honest debate at the end.

Here is the case I present to you. You read it through and go through it point by point and try to convince us why it is that we should dismiss this, not count it, or vote for Trump.

Here ya go... American Veterans are all always about, country before self. Death before dishonor. Now, try to imagine what evil would have to be on the inside of an American president who would steal from these guys when he knows very well that many of them are now homeless, that many of them go hungry at night, that many of them can not get the help that they need to deal with the trauma the fighting put in them.

Imagine a president who would steal the very contributions that good American people like yourselves, contributed to these brave and loyal men for them in their hard times.

He stole big from them, 2 million dollars and without a single bit of shame and put it in his pocket for himself. He didn't have an attack of conscience and put it back and say to himself hey, that is just too dirty of a thing to do, at any time.

Keep in mind, he fought in court that he might get away with it. Because we all know when he had been caught, he could have bought his way out of it. He could have said look, I fucked up and I will make it right, here's 5 million if we can just let this go. Trump is used to pay-offs for his crimes so he knew he could have done that. Instead, he fought it.

So, after he didn't do that, who on earth would want such an evil son of a bitch as their president? The answer is as follows: Every single Evangelical that should be screaming from the roof tops. Instead, they stand in solidarity with him. Every single Christian should turn their backs on him like they do someone who is gay. No, the Christians and the Evangelicals will continue their full throat-ed support for this insane monster. Yeah, let's have another photo opp of all those good people standing up for and associating themselves with this piece of crap to make him not look like the monster we all know he is.. You try so hard to lend him respectability. It doesn't work that way, he shares his shame and makes it yours and you should know that we see that plainly.

Of course,every single GOP elected official will continue to sing the praises of this monster, ugly, dirty, rotten thief, who steals from those who stood in the breech and defended our freedoms as if their sacrifice, their deaths, their sufferings, meant nothing to him or them.

We can't forget the loyal republican base either. Hey there you are right there, loyal Trump base, yup that's you. You, still love Donald Trump as if he were the very best president we ever had. Obviously it does not offend your sensibilities at all or of course you would have called him out if it did. You who support a president who willingly and happily steals from our WAR VETERANS are 100% as guilty as he is for as long as you support him.

Death before dishonor....... Except if you are Trump or his supporters or the GOP, then it's steal from our vets to win.. They don't matter anyway, winning at any price is always worth it. Trump 2020 right???....

I'll await your valued and considered explanation as to why this man should even still be in office at this point. I know you can justify anything at all, no matter how insane or cruel. Let's hear from you now please.....

Understand every single person on the planet got this news and we all know he went to court over it and plead guilty to it so no fake news bull shit...The floor is yours, explain to all of us why we should vote for Trump when we all know he did this thing to our war heroes, to our Veterans who fought for our country.

No deflecting, no what aboutism, no, the other guy did some other bad thing.

Just straight up say why do we want a president who we know, for a fact, did this, to our War hero's, our Veterans.

Say straight up, yes or no, if a man, any man, committed an act as evil as this, is that man fit to be the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?

Yes or no?

You have the floor sir or ma'am.

The most important point [made in the Prosecution's closing arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/stones-trial-closing-arguments.html): **Stone lied to protect the Trump campaign**.

&gt;“He knew that **if the truth came out about what he was doing in 2016, it would look terrible,”** Jonathan Kravis, an assistant United States attorney, told the jurors on the sixth day of Mr. Stone’s trial on charges of deceiving the House Intelligence Committee two years ago. “Roger Stone knew that if this information came out it would look really bad **for his longtime associate Donald Trump.”**

In paticular, they [made sure to get Rick Gates to testify](https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1194278009747972097) to a specific phone call he witnessed in which Stone told Trump personally what was coming from WikiLeaks:

&gt;""After Mr Trump got off the phone with Mr Stone, **what did Trump say?**""
&gt;
&gt;Gates: **“He indicated more information would be coming.""**

Trump was told by Stone as early as July that he was knowledgeable of what WikiLeaks had, knew that they had more hacked content, but for whatever reason the time wasn't right to release it. Then months later...

 - October 7th, 2016 4:00 PM: The [Washington Post reveals the existence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html) of the Access Hollywood tape.

 - Less than *one hour* later: WikiLeaks dumps the [hacked Podesta emails](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/), and releases them in dribs and drabs over the following days to maximize saturation.

[Just as Roger Stone had planned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/29/roger-stone-wanted-wikileaks-email-dump-distract-access-hollywood-tape-associate-claims/):

&gt;The striking simultaneity fulfilled the hope of Trump confidant Roger Stone, according to Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and former Stone associate who was subpoenaed over the summer for questioning by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
&gt;
&gt;“I had one call from Roger, as I recall it — Roger disputes this — **on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, ‘We’ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we’d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,’”** Corsi told MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Monday. 

The story isn't just that Trump believed he had a backchannel to what was coming from the Russia Intelligence cutout WikiLeaks, it's that his campaign efforted to *coordinate* the release with  to ensure the maximum possible benefit to his 2016 campaign. Mueller did not determine that amounted to statutory criminal conspiracy, but it sure as shit amounts to an effort to collude.

It also shows pretty emphatically that Trump lied in the [Take Home Test that Mueller allowed him to take](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/read-trump-s-written-responses-mueller-report-n995851) in lieu of an interview:

&gt;Response to Question II, Part (g) I spoke by telephone with Roger Stone from time to time during the campaign. I have no recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016. I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him, **nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign**, although I was aware that WikiLeaks was the subject of media reporting and campaign-related discussion at the time.

Indeed, Mueller [acknowledged in his testimony to Congress](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller-answers/mueller-says-he-generally-agrees-trump-was-not-always-truthful-in-written-answers-idUSKCN1UJ2R8) that Trump was ""generally"" untruthful in his written testimony.",1

https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-trump-ukraine-too-incoherent-quid-pro-quo-2019-11

Graham's latest defense of Trump is that his policy toward Ukraine is so ""incoherent"" that he's ""incapable"" of orchestrating a quid pro quo in his relations with the country.

""What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward Ukraine: It was incoherent. It depends on who you talk to; they seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo,"" Graham told reporters on Wednesday.

The South Carolina senator on Tuesday said he refused to read transcripts from the testimony of current and former diplomats that were released by House investigators.

One of the diplomats — US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland — in revised testimony corroborated the existence of an explicit quid pro quo involving frozen US military aid to Ukraine and Trump's desire for certain investigations, including an inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden.",1

 27 states are having elections tomorrow, on **November 5th**.

The massive turnout in 2018 resulted in numerous Democrats getting elected to local, state, and federal seats - the blue wave was real. These gains have had obvious impacts from the ability to impeach the president, to the number of bills passed in the house, and allowing state Democrats to prevent voter suppression tactics and gerrymandering. This will be incredibly important when the 2020 presidential candidate is facing off with Trump.

The **MOST** impactful action you can take is to vote in every election, regardless of how competitive it is. Voting once increases the chance of voting again; furthermore, the better Democrats do in elections provides momentum to attempt again the next cycle. **With so many disenfranchised voters supporting democrats, it is incredibly important for us to help Democrats get elected to state legislatures - so they can reduce barriers to voting.**

**Links to resources that will prepare you to vote tomorrow and provide any needed information.** I highly recommend reading the links in order

8. [Find volunteering opportunities on Mobilize.us](https://www.mobilize.us/)
9. Donate on [Act Blue](https://secure.actblue.com/) to Democrats in elections and organizations like [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/) and [League of Conservation Voters](https://www.lcv.org/)

**Tips to improve your voting experience and increase your impact.**

* Figure out how you are getting to polling place.
   * Making a plan and making sure you have a ride to the polling place greatly increases voter turnout.
* Go to the polls as early as you can
   * Lines to vote get longer throughout the day, by going early you can help reduce congestion.
* Bring friends and family with you
* Post a picture of you with an ""I Voted"" sticker on all of your social media
* Share these resources with your network",1

Inserting my own thoughts here: Winning the White House and the Senate are the most important things this cycle. Trump's changing of the courts will greatly impact our future and overturn unjust laws. We've also just lost

The GOP runs several organizations dedicated to winning these elections and need support via volunteering and donations. All of them are extremely important

Do you not want to live with laws like California or soon to be Virginia? Donate to the RSLC and the RGA.

Trump and the RNC are bringing in huge hauls for the national party and for this 2020 campaign. Do not let the downballot races be overlooked!

Full disclosure, I used to be a self aware, full blown ""lib-tard"", and have since come to my senses somewhat to be more rational, and I can understand that both parties have valid tenets and/or policies etc. I'd consider myself more centrist/mixed but leaning towards democratic. 

Pretty much every single post on r/politics and even r/news to some extent is very democratic, and I usually never see any republican-supportive comments (and the few I see are heavily downvoted).

I think it's strange since so many adults in America are Red-leaning or conservative, but I also know that most of reddit's demographic is younger people and younger people are more often democratic.

How do y'all feel about the weird imbalance? Do you feel differently than I do about it?",0

t3_e00ejm,68,"Impeachment Inquiry Discussion: How do we know what is true anymore?
Hi everyone,

As I've closely followed all of the impeachment inquiry activities, I am becoming increasingly confused on what is true anymore. I would like to get some thoughts and input on everything. I would like to lay out, to my understanding, what is fact and what is a derived conclusion, as follows:

**What I understand to be true:**

*-President Trump requested President Zelenskyy to investigate 2 things: Joe/Hunter Biden and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election (this is per the White House transcript)*

*-President Trump had security/military assistance withheld from Ukraine for approximately 1 month, but it was ultimately released*

*-Alexandra Chalupa worked with Ukrainian officials to investigate Paul Manafort during the 2016 election campaign*

*-Lt. Col. Vindman and his direct superior, Tim Morrison, both listened to the July 25th call and interpreted Trump's requests to be inappropriate and relayed their concerns to John Eisenberg, a National Security Council lawyer*

*-Jennifer Williams also listened to the July 25th call and also interpreted the requests to be unusual*

*-President Trump tweeted direct personal attacks on Jennifer Williams and Marie Yovanovitch*

*-President Zelenskyy agreed with President Trump that Marie Yovanovitch was a ""bad ambassador"" and that she ""admired the previous president \[of Ukraine\]""*

*-It was determined that the withholding of security assistance to Ukraine was legal, despite the funds already having been earmarked by congress for such purpose*

*-Security assistance to Ukraine is extremely important for both their national security and the United States' national security*

*-The reason for withholding security assistance is unknown, beyond the statement that it was withheld pending review of alignment with President Trump's intended foreign policy with Ukraine*

**Potential derived conclusions (these are NOT, to my knowledge, confirmed to be true):**

\-*There was no connection between the White House meeting, security assistance, and the investigations, and thus, the impeachment inquiry should not result in actual impeachment*

\-*A White House meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy and security assistance were contingent upon Ukraine investigating the Bidens and the 2016 election interference (""quid pro quo""). Various text messages between US officials seem to indicate this as such, as well as Sondland's testimony*

\-*President Trump's motivations for the investigation requests were political and personal in nature (this is extremely hard to determine)*

So given all of the above information, and having watched hours of hearings and testimonies, I have no idea what to believe here. The ultimate question seems to come down to 2 things: If the White House meeting and security assistance were contingent upon the investigations, and if the request for those investigations were political and personal in nature. If those 2 items can be confidently answered, couldn't this impeachment inquiry end? Any thoughts or input?",0

Opening Testimony
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpHgVO4OlCY

 
“We did not receive satisfactory explanations for *any* of the errors we identified”.

So while the left are screaming that his investigation found no evidence of political bias or “deep state”, it is clear that the IG is suspicious. But unlike Mueller he isn’t going to make claims without evidence.

Horowitz also states in his opening testimony that these individuals knew they were working on a highly sensitive case that would be under a lot of scrutiny. Implying that it is unlikely they would make such mistakes in the first place.

The only “pass” Horowitz gives to the FBI is that the initial Crossfire investigation was legitimate within the rules of the FBI, though he recommends some changes to the rules and procedures due to the sensitivity of such a case. Barr disagrees with that assessment, thinking only a preliminary investigation was warranted at that time.

The leadership within the FBI are pleading ignorance on the investigation and its failures. So effectively wide spread incompetence is their defense. Not only were the agents on Crossfire supposedly incompetent, but the leadership overseeing them were also incompetent. And all of this incompetence magically seemed to be biased towards hurting Trump and his campaign. Not a single error made went in his favor. Trump is just an unlucky guy.

We are left with the same conundrum we were faced with the IRS targeting tea party groups. Was there an actual conspiracy. Or were each and every one of these people individually motivated by political bias that allowed for this to happen? As in they didn’t need to be told to be assholes, they were naturally assholes. I think conspiracy will be hard to prove unless someone actually admits to it or an email chain of some sort can show it. We do have the text messages of some of the agents showing their bias and intentions, but not in relation to their actual actions while conducting this incompetent investigation.

----

Graham Cross Examination:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-mYmQsTC8

 

Here’s my take:

 

- No Defensive Briefing to the Trump campaign. Gave defensive briefing to the Clinton campaign. No explanation for why. No real reason except...

- No warning to Trump or trusted career prosecutors like Rudy and Christie about the perceived risk to the campaign. Which is odd for any “counter intelligence” operation. The goal of such an investigation is to protect the campaign and the election process. Yet making no attempt to reach out to the campaign suggests that was not their motivation at all.

- When evidence came out that their underlying basis to suspect Russian agents in the Trump campaign proved false, lied to continue the FISA warrant process. They lied 3 different times. One time could be construed as a mistake/oversight. Two a coincidence, it took them a while to realize they had jack shit to base the warrant off of. Three time suggests criminal intent to abuse the FISA process. And this goes all the way up the chain of command in the FBI. Horowitz doesn't make this determination, but he wasn't tasked to.

- When they gave a half ass “Defensive Briefing” to Trump, long after Clinton, they straight up spied on Trump and log it. As in again attempting to catch him saying something incriminating. No evidence according to Horowitz (even classified) that Trump was a suspect or had any evidence of wrong doing on his part.

- Fast forward to President Trump. Trump who is being harassed by the media for the “Russian Collusion” conspiracy theory asks Comey to make it clear that he (Trump) is under no such investigation. Comey refuses to do so. Long after it was obvious the FISA warrants were baseless and should have been terminated.

- Trump fires Comey as it is clear that he is undermining his administration and is a snake. Trump has already heard reports that his campaign was being spied on (which the media and the left ridiculed Trump for even suggesting).

- Comey later writes a book stating the only reason he even reopend the investigation against Hillary right before the election was to help legitimize her administration. As in pure political motive to help her. Has repeatedly made political accusations and attacks on Trump and Republicans. Like the FBI agents who spied on Trump during the campaign, Comey took confidential notes of every meeting and sent them to a uncleared lawyer (all information in the government is FOUO, you don’t even need to be told it is classified. A conversation with the president is beyond a doubt at least a confidential conversation). Again spying. 

- Jeff Sessions shows himself to be a tool and allows a friend of Comey to take charge on a possible investigation. We get a two year witch hunt that concludes there was no evidence that the Trump campaign (or anyone on it) colluded with Russia, but they couldn’t rule out Obstruction. Which is purely a political statement to feed Democrats, as if you have no evidence of obstruction, there is no obstruction. Proving a negative is impossible.

- All of this spying and operations happened under Obama’s watch. There is no way the FBI is wire taping a political rival’s campaign and the White House and DOJ are unaware of it. Horowitz makes it clear that DOJ officials were made aware of the entire investigation as soon as the FISA process started. The Obama white house again see’s no issue. Politically smart people who are corrupt to their core aren’t even concerned about optics. But considering the IRS targeting Tea Party groups under Obama and Dinesh D’souza who gave an illegal campaign contribution to a friend who lost her election and was in debt was sent to prison by Obama (the crime has never earned anyone a prison sentence before) this doesn’t seem too far outside their usual channels of corruption. Obama literally deployed his state department to lie on national television about Bhengazi for nearly a month so his narrative that terrorism was on the retreat and he and Hillary didn’t completely screw up on the 9/11 anniversary didn’t tank his re-election. Government resources being utilized for his personal gain.

- Feinstein’s questions are pointless to watch. She makes swipes at Durham (who is likely going to nuke Democrats with his report) and AG Barr. And tries to pretend as if they are the same investigations. Horowitz was tasked in determining if FISA abuse occurred during the Russia collusion investigation, that was the scope of his investigation. He determined there was substantial abuse. Her only real contribution is bringing up a “friendly foreign source” that fed into the FBI’s investigation. Barr contends this was not sufficient for a full investigation, only a preliminary investigation. Horowitz thinks it can be used for both. But even if Horowitz is correct, it again shows bias to the detriment of Trump. As in every time there are two possibilities the decisions made have a clear bias. Feinstein then wastes the time of the IG on questions unrelated to his report that are highly political bullshit.

----

Cruz’s Take:
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5R8x_jSNI

- CIA gave evidence to clear Carter Page, stating he was a reliable source on Russia. FBI lawyer took that evidence and modified it to state the exact opposite “not a source” to fool the FISA court. Supposedly no one else in the FBI was aware of this modification.

- The FBI omitted to the FISA court that the dossier was fully funded by the DNC. Claiming ignorance would not work as one of the members of the FBI leadership his wife literally worked for Fusion GPS who helped put that together. Also major conflict of interest on that person’s part.

- The FBI used several wire tapped individuals to question several of the suspected Russian agents while they served on the Trump campaign, as well as a senior Trump official who was under no suspicion. “Not spying” the democrats are latching onto.

- Horowitz claims that when these “spy” events occurred, the FBI kept it pretty close to their chest. This shields the Obama White House at least in these particular instances. It still may have gotten back to them as portions of it were reported to the DOJ, but there is no direct evidence that the AG knew or the Obama White house.

- “This wasn’t Jason Bourne, this was Beavus and Butthead”. I think this remark from Cruz suggests incompetence of this level is not believable. I agree, as would any rational person reviewing what happened here.

My further take is that those involved were so sure Trump was guilty, or that they would find something, that their violations wouldn’t matter. That they would be justified. Ends justify the means is the typical mantra of the left. Though I question if Trump had really been a Russian asset if the criminal trial wouldn’t have been thrown out based on the actions taken by operation Crossfire Hurricane. Which further illustrates a political motive. Their goal was to stop Trump from becoming president and later to remove him as president at all costs. There wasn’t a goal of ensuring criminal conduct be properly vetted and that justice be held.

---

I don't think Horowitz deserves as much flak as he is getting from conservatives. He sticks to the facts as much as he can and makes no attempt to conclude guilt without evidence (unlike Mueller's ridiculous assertion on Obstruction). Also keep in mind his investigation is focused purely on FISA abuse in the Crossfire Investigation. He found the abuse. It was not a criminal investigation into the FBI actors.",0

t3_e8xlli,68,"Reading the Impeachment Charges House Democrats Are Bringing Forward
It appears that Democrats have written these Articles of Impeachment in such a way to guarantee them to fail as hard as possible.  Anyone who spends more than an instant looking at these can see that these are a complete sham.

Let’s begin by discussing the things these articles do not accuse the president:

* Collusion with Russia – Robert Mueller has specifically said that there was no evidence that President Trump or anyone else in the administration conspired with the Russian government at all.

* Obstructing the Russian investigation – Robert Mueller stated that they did not have sufficient evidence to charge the president of obstruction.  Despite Democrats lies, that is nothing but legalese “we didn’t have the goods on the president.”  He named eleven things that kind of looked like they might have been obstruction, but he couldn’t bring himself to make even an accusation.

* Bribery – Bribery is literally one of the crimes named in the constitution that officials can be impeached for.  That Democrats couldn’t bring bribery as a charge, even though they were floating it as a possible charge two weeks ago, means that as hard as they tried, they couldn’t make the case to House Democrats.

* Conspiracy with Ukraine – For the last several weeks, the claim that Donald Trump was conspiring with Ukrainian president Zelensky has been the purported focus of the investigation.  Withholding funds in order to destroy a political opponent would be conspiracy and it’s likely an impeachable offense.  Democrats are not making this claim with these impeachment “charges.”   It also finally puts to bed the lie that the phone records President Trump put out weren’t complete.  I’ve gone over that the header stating it’s not “complete” had nothing to do with the discussion, but with translators’ and transcribers’ ability to get every point down as intended by the parties involved.

None of the above points are part of the Democrats impeachment charges: House Democrats have given up on them.  They are not valid arguments and by not making them part of the impeachment, Democrats have slammed the book on them.

That leaves us with the two charges that will be brought before the House Judiciary Committee and, presumably, the House floor.

1. **Abuse of Power** – Let’s just begin with this specific point: “Abuse of Power” is not a crime.  It’s an accusation, but it’s such a vague statement that it could range anywhere from treason to taking two scoops of ice cream.  It is literally designed to be a coverall for all the things that Democrats want you to believe about Donald Trump, but don’t have the evidence or courage to actually charge him for.  It’s actually really sad that Democrats really think they can even attempt this, because in doing so, they’re attempting to make anything that they don’t like about any future presidents’ actions an “abuse of power.”  Who decides what “abuse of power” is?  Since it’s not legally defined, it’s literally nothing more than the opposition party’s definition of what counts.  But attempting to use this as a charge, Democrats are setting up every president moving forward under the constant cloud of impeachment.

2. **Obstruction of Congress** – Not only is this not a crime, it’s not even a thing.  It doesn’t exist.  What Jerry Nadler is attempting to call “Obstruction of Congress” is nothing more than Constitutional Separation of Powers.  Here’s how we know this is a case.  House Democrats attempted to issue subpoenas to several administration officials, including Rudy Giuliani.  As they work for the president, they claimed they are not subject to the legislative branch and filed lawsuits stating that they were under the authority of the president, not Congress.  Those lawsuits are literally pending: all House Democrats had to do were to wait for the courts to make a ruling, and then stand on the call to whomever the courts agreed should be required to testify.  Then, if Donald Trump still refused to let those officials speak, that would be Obstruction of Justice.  House Democrats did not wait.  Perhaps they didn’t think that the courts would agree with them; perhaps they knew that there was nothing to get out of the Executive Branch officials; perhaps both.  However, in not waiting, they are tacitly admitting that there is no obstruction of justice, and therefore, have come up with the sham article “Obstruction of Congress.”

It is quite the shame that House Democrats are acting on such flimsy and indefensible attempts at charging the president, because instead of issuing false charges and letting them fail, which absolutely would have happened, they are offering charges which don’t exist under the law, and are therefore undefinable.  If you were charged for committing a crime, but the prosecutor couldn’t name an actual crime that could be found on the books, your case would be thrown out in a matter of minutes, and you would probably have a case to sue the prosecutor for false prosecution, and this is no different.

You don’t have to be a Trump supporter to see that this is institutionalized railroading, and the consequences of even attempting them could be far reaching and dangerous to the country.",0

In the hours after the shooting rampage in Jersey City, I wonder what the media and authorities are not saying about this?  Did anyone notice that they were very quick to attempt to trot out that they didn't believe it was linked to terrorism?  Now that it's early morning there are some news reports that say 'They specifically targeted the Kosher Grocery' but again no mention of the T-word.

Why are they being so tight-lipped about any info on the shooters?  There isn't even a clear report on whether it's a man and a woman or two men; the police chief said two men, the NY Times has a report of a man and a woman.

How will they spin this if they had illegal guns in a state that has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country including an assault weapon ban and a magazine capacity ban?

This seems dodgy if you ask me.",0

It snowed last night...

8:10 - A feminist passed by and asked me why I didn't make a snow woman.

8:15 - So, I made a snow woman.

8:17 - My feminist neighbor complained about the snow woman's voluptuous chest saying it objectified snow women everywhere.

8:20 - The gay couple living nearby threw a hissy fit and moaned it could have been two snow men instead.

8:22 - The transgender man..women...person asked why I didn't just make one snow person with detachable parts.

8:25 - The vegans at the end of the lane complained about the carrot nose, as veggies are food and not to decorate snow figures with.

8:28 - I was being called a racist because the snow couple is white.

8:31 - The middle eastern gent across the road demanded the snow woman be covered up .

8:40 - The Police arrived saying someone had been offended.

8:42 - The feminist neighbor complained again that the broomstick of the snow woman needed to be removed because it depicted women in a domestic role.

8:43 - The council equality officer arrived and threatened me with eviction.

8:45 - TV news crew from CBS showed up. I was asked if I know the difference between snowmen and snow-women? I replied ""Snowballs"" and am now called a sexist.

9:00 - I was on the News as a suspected terrorist, racist, homophobe sensibility offender, bent on stirring up trouble during difficult weather.

9:10 - I was asked if I have any accomplices. My children were taken by social services.

9:29 - Far left protesters offended by everything marched down the street demanding for me to be arrested.

By noon it all melted

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

t3_e7ox69,130,"A (Negative) Response to “The [United States] is being run by a government that no longer represents the people” by Michael Gordon
Recently, Business Insider opinion contributor Michael Gordon wrote that “The \[United States\] is being run by a government that no longer represents the people”. ( [https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-supreme-court-senate-president-represent-minority-views-2019-12?IR=T?utm\_source=copy-link&amp;utm\_medium=referral&amp;utm\_content=topbar](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-government-supreme-court-senate-president-represent-minority-views-2019-12?IR=T?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=topbar) )

I perceive that Gordon has assumed that Democratic Party politicians represent the people better than Republican Party politicians. I believe that such a view is erroneous — most of today’s politicians who largely live in rich neighbourhoods are largely detached from the daily struggles of the working and middle classes.

I also perceive that the article assumes that the Democratic Party is altruistic whilst the Republican Party is overly self-interested. I also believe that such a view is erroneous: Why was former Democratic National Committee chairperson Schultz exposed for favouring Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary and plotting against rival Sanders?  ( [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders) ) Is such a thing altruistic and not self-interested?

What I have been observing on the Internet for far too long is the culture war between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party being framed as a battle between the Good, Altruistic, Progressive Party against the Evil, Self-interested, Regressive Party. If such a extreme partisanship is promoted too long soon we might have calls for a single-party (Democratic Party) system like the People’s Republic of China (single-party system under the Communist Party of China). And that is too dangerous for a country like the United States of America.

I believe that only a few politicians are genuinely altruistic, if at all. And altruism is not the monopoly of any party.

Furthermore, the government’s job is not to do everything as commanded by the majority. Instead it is meant to secure human rights and civil liberties of all. That is why the United States is a (classical) liberal democratic representative **republic**. If the government does not do certain things that the majority wants, then it is the responsibility of society to push for such reforms on a cultural level, not a government level.",0

t3_e6vt49,19,"The Kids are Not OK
The kids are not alright. Children today live a life radically and completely different than the one you remember having and the outcomes will be far reaching within our society. While it has been routine for centuries for the older generations to decry the changes they see occurring within the younger generations and their failure to do things as they believe they should be done. I believe that the present situation facing children has changed so drastically that it deserves a closer look into the specifics. 

From the moment a baby is born they are curious and in search of new information and experiences. They might not know what they are seeking but do pretty well. Unfortunately for society it is this time frame that determines the trajectory of a child by and large. Physical Activity, Speech/language skills, and exposure to screens are all major ways that a babies development may be delayed or even botched for years(or their life) to come. 

Babies that are slow to roll over tend to be slow to stand and walk, putting them behind other babies in musculoskeletal strength. And when they become little kids, the little kids that cant keep up with their peers will always turn to the physically easier activity if presented the option. That is part of the reason that fewer kids are partpicating in sports now and child hood obesity rates are three times higher now than in 1970. 

Babies that are slow to develop speech and language skills frequently have difficulty reading, writing and communicating for life. It can also lead to social isolation, depression, and increase the anxiety many people have with public speaking. Little kids that have trouble with language skills are more likely to be violent, are more likely to do poorly in class, and are more likely to spend time on a screen. 

Little kids that have used screens from birth are significantly more likely to prefer watching media or playing on an electronic device to any other option presented to them at five. It also is associated with decreases in the communication, motor skills, problem-solving and personal social skills that these kids have at five and onward. 

Once that five year old is finally in elementrary school it is largely too late, their setbacks are vast and large and the system is not capable of making up for five years of neglect and being left to watch shows. Kindergartens are increasingly faced with having to bring everyone to the same level in their social skills, communication and problem solving ability but having the majority have issues they didn't have a decade ago in that development. 

It just snowballs from there, every negative thing that happens in life is easily solvable with some screen time. A quick youtube video to make them laugh and not be depressed. Time on Fortnight to take out the anger. Pintrest for “creative inspiration” and work to be copied. Instagram and facebook to keep in touch with family and see the life you wish you had. Twitter to post your hot takes you would dare share publicly. 4chan and reddit for memes. Jacking it to pornhub. All of which are new or been significantly redesigned within the last five years for maximum user engagement and available whenever you have time for them. Timelines are no longer in a liner order, but algomorathically programmed to create endless scrolling opportunities. Video games have more in common with slot machines from the 90’s than Doom or Super Mario 64. Battle Royale has clearly won the FPS genera and thus “hard core gamers” constantly have crack to enjoy as they hop from game to game seeking their next dopamine rush inbetween buying another lootbox that will surely change their luck. 

All of this has been thrust into the eager arms of children primed to want nothing but retreat into a dark room with a screen. 

But it gets worse from there. What happens when the 10 year old whos played fortnight his entire life (with microphones) repeats a “joke” he heard in a game at school thats on color and racist? What are the chances that that 10 year old listens to the person yelling at /telling them they are doing something wrong when in their pocket they have 50 people cheering them on and telling them for the first time ever that their a bad ass for trolling their teacher? That support is encouraging and will only sink that individual further into the behavior. Behavior that will be unchecked by a parent as the parent had long ceded the authority over watching what's going on on the screen or setting any sort of limit on it. Allowing their kids to become all manner of horrible beings. 

I have largely focused on boys and games thus far in my cirtique of the 10 year old, but I think that the addiction to screens is much more negative in girls. This is largely because the type of media consumed by each gender. While the boys are by and large yelling at eachother and playing fortnight with people around the nation, girls prefer to remain close to those in their more immediate presence through their screens. Secret groups, chatrooms, and gossip are all favorites of 10 year old girls and have been for ever, they will likely remain so. But they effects of these and the feeling of isolation that comes from seeing others engaging with one another on a screen leads to lots of resentment, competitiveness, and general cattiness. Coupled with significantly more having weight issues and not seeing themselves as having what the quintessential “popular girl” has. The popular girl has also changed, while it used to be enough to be the hottest girl in the school, now you are forced to compete with every girl in the entire nation for popularity and clout. Thats why the single most desired career for 13 year olds is to be an influancer. 

Simply put, while it is an old trope, the changes that we have experienced in society and how we have adapted to use screens in our daily lives are having lasting negative impacts upon our kids. Impacts that we as a society must correct or suffer the consquences for.

*This post is basically just a summation of why I believe Josh Hawley and Co. represent what should be the future of conservatism in America. Also discussed are social media, environmentalism, and more! I hope you find this illuminating, Dear Reader.*

----------------------

# [Josh Hawley's Mission to Remake the GOP](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/josh-hawley-trumpism-gop/602365/)

This article comes from my favorite writer at the Atlantic, Emma Green, who has done really good work covering religion. For example, [this
article](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/iraqi-christians-nineveh-plain/589819/) about the criminally overlooked persecution of Christians in the Middle East is not something you’d usually find outside of conservative media. Now, on to the article.

I think Senator Hawley represents something very exciting for the future of American conservatism. While Senator Rubio is focused on the economic side of things, with his [“Common Good Capitalism](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/the-case-for-common-good-capitalism/) and push for [paid family leave](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/3/rubio-romney-wagner-crenshaw-introduce-bill-giving-parents-an-option-for-paid-family-leave), among other things, Senator Hawley seems to focus more on the social aspects, condemning the [“Pelagian vision”](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/june-web-only/age-of-pelagius-joshua-hawley.html) of hyper-individualism that has led to the destruction of the most important of social institutions, especially the church and the family. His willingness to call out the establishment for contributing to this trend is, in my opinion, very admirable.

For far too long have the establishment Republicans ignored social conservatives’ demands for even a bit of assistance in maintaining any sort of social order, instead deciding to cut taxes for the very same elites and megacorporations that are perpetuating this disatrous trend. And even if some social conservatives [dare to speak up](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2019/03/against-the-dead-consensus) about the shortcomings of this arrangement, they are mercilessly derided as [“theocratic”](https://newrepublic.com/article/154608/first-things-magazine-american-theocracy-religious-state ) or even [“fascist”](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/marco-rubios-half-baked-political-philosophy/) because they think there should be more to conservatism than laissez-faire capitalism. Additionally, the GOP's ([and the Democrats'](https://theweek.com/articles/846330/how-democratic-party-internalized-libertarianism), for that matter) obsession with personal freedom above all else contributes to that same Pelagian vision that Hawley accurately states leads to oligarchy:

&gt; Because if freedom means choice among options, then the people with the most choices are the most free. And that means the rich. And if salvation is about achievement, then those with the most accolades are righteous, and that means the elite and the strong.

In this way, Hawley echoes Russell Kirk regarding the dangers of hyper-individualism. From the latter's Ninth [Conservative Principle](https://kirkcenter.org/conservatism/ten-conservative-principles/): 

&gt; When every person claims to be a power unto himself, then society falls into anarchy. Anarchy never lasts long, being intolerable for everyone, and contrary to the ineluctable fact that some persons are more strong and more clever than their neighbors. To anarchy there succeeds tyranny or oligarchy, in which power is monopolized by a very few.

It is clear that the elites of the world have achieved their lofty position through their exertion of power and participation in a system that has allowed them to [amass vast quantities of wealth](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42745853) while everyone else is left behind. Then, having achieved this position, the elites use their cultural influence to destroy those social institutions that aided the lower classes. The results of this, as Hawley states again in the Pelagianism speech, are disastrous:

&gt; These Americans haven’t seen a real wage increase in 30 years. These Americans are fighting to hold their families together, as divorce rates surge. For these Americans, healthcare is unaffordable. Drug addiction is growing. And too many of their local communities, especially rural ones, have been gutted as industry consolidates and ships jobs away. 

Senator Hawley has correctly identified the problem, but it remains to be seen what he will do about it. I applaud his [willingness to challenge](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/12/josh-hawley-republican-judges-1362687) judicial nominees regarding the sincerity of their pro-life stance, as well as his push to [regulate social media companies more](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/14/750585438/senator-pushes-bill-to-curb-exploitative-and-addictive-social-media-practices), but that latter point will be discussed more later on.

Overall, while Senator Hawley is not perfect, he, along with Senator Rubio, represent a long-overdue movement in American conservatism away from pure free-market capitalism and libertarian social policy towards something more holistic and orderly. Both Senators should be, in my opinion, ones to watch.

----

It is here where I will shift my focus away from Senator Hawley and on to other issues that I believe are important for people like him to consider as they influence the new Right that comes into being in the post-Trump era.

I discussed at length the economic woes of the working class in the previous section, but it was not the economic anxiety that contributed to the ""left-behind"" feeling among the white working class that is said to have delivered President Trump the White House; rather, it was a sense of [""cultural displacement""](https://www.prri.org/research/white-working-class-attitudes-economy-trade-immigration-election-donald-trump/). While such data is often used as an excuse to label all Trump supporters as racists and white nationalists, I believe it speaks to something greater, beyond the issue of race. Rather, it describes the great spiritual emptiness of America. Everyone laughed at Marianne Williamson when she cited the [""dark psychic force""](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marianne-williamson-warns-of-dark-psychic-force-of-trump-in-viral-debate-moment) as being what afflicts us, but she is not wrong. [As religion has declined in America](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/), [deaths of despair](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/opinion/sunday/the-age-of-american-despair.html) have become the norm, destroying lives everywhere. Combating these issues and the forces behind them should be a top priority for political leaders, whether it be the [meth and fetanyl crisis](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fentanyl-kills-more-people-east-meth-west-n1070871) or [rise in alcohol-related deaths (especially in rural areas)](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/7/E815) to the [horrifying increase in teenage suicide](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/teen-suicide-study-increase-why-900711/).

That last trend is especially worrying to me, as a young person. I know of several attempted suicides among students at my former high school, and I know of many of my friends who have harbored those thoughts or simply a general despair about life. I certainly believe that social media has a large part to do with it, though it seems that the [available data doesn't support that conclusion](https://freebeacon.com/issues/are-smartphones-and-social-media-hurting-our-kids/). Rather, I believe that the overall stress of young peoples lives, especially in the context of the ever more competitive college admissions process, is having a [negative effect on our mental health](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/gen-z).

This overall anxiety, especially when coupled with climate change hysteria, has disastrous implications. I know from first-hand experience of the jokes we make amongst ourselves about how nothing matters since everyone will die from climate-change related events in the next half-century, which has led to some to [swear off having children](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change) for [the sake of the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children). Don't get me wrong, climate change is a real problem, and has been ignored by American conservatives at their own peril. Any future conservatism must have environmentalism and conservationism as an integral part.

Lastly, I want to revisit a topic I mentioned before: elite influence of culture and their use of it to destroy institutions. Look no further than the mainstream media's recent (and disgusting) push for [non-monogamous relationships](https://ifstudies.org/blog/have-1-in-5-americans-been-in-a-consensual-non-monogamous-relationship). The #MeToo movement as well as the Epstein affair revealed a system where the elites use the exploited lower classes to fulfill their most depraved desires, as part of a broader trend of a relaxing of the norms surrounding sexual morality. For instance, ""drag kids"" and the entire [tragedy of transgender youth](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/12/09/the-tragedy-of-the-trans-child/) is simply a logical following from a refusal of conservatives to fight these drastic social changes that are being foisted upon us.

-------

What form will American conservatism take in the future? It's too early to say, but as a young conservative, I think at least paying attention some of the things outlined above would be of great advantage to the leaders on the Right of tomorrow.

*Welcome back to our discussion about platforms and democracy! I had a great time meeting* Interface *readers last week at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay and the Conference on New Media and Democracy at Tufts University. I also made great progress on a special report I plan to have for you here before the end of the year. But enough prelude — on with today’s update.*

“I’m one of the last people you’d expect to hear warning about the danger of conspiracies and lies,” the actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen said today in [an op-ed in the *Washington Post*](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h2/cCgmMiFATr20XfiZfvCwAWfcGz2thIrXxT-2BijBjLnbqEPcuantzamhIm8xbNEv-2F7It2iL4wPOM3MJUykv6pIRy-2FpBYPo4TJBC37oZ-2BB1zrKqa9ARzpPOpxTjCkcf1d9W-2BmxK8yCbfOfG2oTLKpY-2Bm7yZ25fyhOJuA8qFSHaANmtZPfm-2FHBKeXZ1p18alzJxYpMMhnca-2BZV4PyOGcSpZdTw3AjpOvWpiShe7lCkUQEsN1m34jidH7bAPQhuZxPJjyBZA7WDPAZkdk2LklcEH5UA-3D-3D/OGXj), adapted from [last week’s viral speech](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h3/KmSwdmspjzgZvWBOGuKtq7ruadz8ydDHa0uit85kZXEE-2FvWGdl8RAhh0bL0d8d28Ey7CVRWUGC6u07TedeI1glN-2BZBThis6SCogm4tWr-2BpuASDBW-2Buu-2B4aZfcE7AizLAjPf8hSrbAIyfBNsSCJgwM7d8XY0ZYPHw3l2rhRQHmDk-3D/7n_9) about the dangers of social networks at an Anti-Defamation League conference.

In fact, Cohen is exactly the sort of person I’d expect to be warning us about social networks. As a rich celebrity who has no need for the free communication tools they provide, and who can thrive without relying on the promotional benefits that come with active use of the platforms, blasting Big Tech costs Cohen nothing.

Meanwhile, few people would have ever even heard of Cohen’s speech had it not thrived on social media — first on Twitter, then on YouTube — where social media critiques, particularly of Facebook, have grown increasingly popular. In coming to bury the big platforms, Cohen inadvertently proved their benefit: providing a wide lane for an outsider — in this case, a comedian with no previous experience as a tech pundit — to come in and start a worthwhile discussion.

To be sure, Cohen raises some valuable points — and he does so with more nuance and detail than the average “Zuck sucks” Twitter egg in my mentions. (Note the way he cites academic research in his links — a welcome touch.) Cohen is right, for example, about the unique danger of algorithmic recommendations on social platforms — the way they give fringe viewpoints unearned reach, and recruit followers for violent ideologies, most prominently on the far right:

*The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately* [*amplify*](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h4/9kEQTmwPP7TrosC0lLAnlWnUyRXnHzO7o3wOY-2FTD4OEi4ARS4pTTIzQ7LY-2BXUUs7dBXnZs838EOsJqsWC6-2BEdGloMAKLuKVibztjowXOMOna4ivQLd81PCoExkKXynEbO5AFCbamOtCieHBBFn2ugelIblb-2B-2BOEkce3bP876QD9f16u1ZYNMFIUX1o4Gm20n/WaE9) *content that keeps users engaged — stories that appeal to our baser instincts and trigger outrage and fear.

*On the Internet, everything can appear equally legitimate. Breitbart resembles the BBC, and the rantings of a lunatic seem as credible as the findings of a Nobel Prize winner. We have lost a shared sense of the basic facts upon which democracy depends.*

Cohen also picks up on issue we have discussed here quite often in recent months: the fact that large technology companies, thanks to a combination of ignorance and inattention from our elected officials, are essentially accountable to no one, even as their products have unleashed dangerous, rippling butterfly effects the world over:

*These super-rich “Silicon Six” care more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy. This is ideological imperialism — six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they’re above the reach of law. Surely, instead of letting the Silicon Six decide the fate of the world order, our democratically elected representatives should have at least some say.*

Amen.

Unfortunately, Cohen’s proposed solution for making tech platforms accountable is to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make Facebook and other sites legally liable for what their users post. He approvingly cites the passage last year of FOSTA-SESTA, an act nominally intended to reduce sex trafficking that was really about scrubbing sexual content off the internet. By all accounts, it has done almost nothing to reduce sex trafficking. Instead, it has [forced sex workers to once again rely on abusive pimps and put themselves into unnecessary danger](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h7/FjjDnILCuToBIudnotke-2FCovu9yQkPCrIak2kOl1dQOlJY8RSyQ1mj4TThxXQMEwTE975SNoxhp1i1Y7jEos4zdwYdpHlanBrPxQ9ZQB3ACrYVzF10hjcT4Dto2UzGUr26MHaiUFMQbjBRPUbmA3mPw0P7ULPEQuva6EDF8OQPp8MTYmdoY5ua40PtuEBMq8XjpbBa-2FPE9Ppzp-2BSCIVo6A-3D-3D/ikKf).

Websites reacted to the passage of FOSTA-SESTA [by overreacting](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h8/4Y4XcHz4TiB8wSeIcYwTjQSw7obwCqK9CEsLKFKhc4JhK7Urt-2BaXn-2BXW-2FuAhcMR6yxZ5JLknataP9Z2Db7YwoZLhvos7UECuFS-2FUysKSpFQZ6St3HHquubKfZYB3Shyy2h0db0t-2FgKBa9YJWeXRHfTQtEpUKWcZDuzDrbBCixws-3D/yLcB). Once Craigslist could be found legally liable for unwittingly hosting an ad that enabled sex trafficking, it removed all personals from its service altogether. Reddit removed several communities associated with sex work. Several sites that allowed sex workers to vet potential clients [shut down entirely](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h9/3P5RWkLOTHF92epaoPjXnqcExkiwZbLkhTPaKbverbNiN43MuHe4YOHMiMHcONgQKcroHlRqlzRCHTSIvfGnz-2BbrjumdTtWDk-2FPWQFAbEDpdrov13ywOA9QsWTvXWSsfnSz3mKOQu0esvGBpUXQiDZS1xCfKDZjSJzd1SMfBWUqibJS9H-2BT-2FIn-2BBBV4jH0Gp8zrxoRxJQetDz5-2BuBDULegvR2VL4Dn9J6C2HvF1noXA-3D/lffF).

It seems likely that amending Section 230 to introduce what scholars call “intermediary liability” for Facebook et al would play out in much the same way: by over-moderating and censoring speech. In an environment in which democracy is in retreat around the world, and the internet is increasingly controlled by far-right authoritarian governments, the prospect of surging censorship in our communications tools sends a chill down my spine. How will Cohen feel when a government orders the takedown of one of his satires across the entire internet? If 230 disappears, and other countries adopt similar measures, I can’t imagine a likelier target.

Moreover, it’s Section 230 that enables platforms to be more aggressive in pulling down hate speech and abusive content — the outcome that Cohen argues for most passionately in his speech. His argument to eliminate Section 230 protections glosses right over this point, likely because Cohen misunderstands [what Section 230 actually does](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h10/pf1JvXXz0HA6Uk3h4thQp9ZUbP6rCEDUZLMWy9uoUOpPUTidJ6V9rXbaXcFlOFSC4MeRn6zRoFbyq9z1vFeCUuqr5ySEKVkGb9RAPrD-2F-2BQP-2BA-2BxB3w09lsEWcbQXxq7MpyrGgooQmNw9k4-2B-2FkhsrBAs0-2Bb7WXTt9JYVb7NPDkuIEMYuFMYgXuKEipwfnBXwMscKK-2B92JDNyXzy8hQWTArwqZHiKJgaOKmTCPxEzr-2B3AeqUeYEvzkMpstVKz-2FtM4IYt-2FhkZugqeUuohXkfZJUWOoIl3cMK7nPVsaA1NSiRkw-3D/SQry).

Those qualms aside, what has stayed with me most about Cohen’s speech is the way it captures the new conventional wisdom among left-leaning critics: that Facebook disproportionately benefits the right wing. (Plenty of conservatives believe the exact opposite, of course.)

The thought that Facebook empowers the far right is not exactly new. Anxiety that Facebook had become a handmaiden to the conservative movement lay at the root of Cambridge Analytica blowing up into a global scandal in 2018, two years after we knew most of the details. (We knew that Facebook was sharing our data with third parties. What most of us didn’t know was that third parties were using that data as part of sophisticated, micro-targeted political influence campaigns.)

But there is new evidence of Facebook’s material support of the right wing. In the *Wall Street Journal* this weekend, [Deepa Seetharaman profiled James Barnes](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h12/o-2BAZr62zWC6QdrQqnnZskaU065kRdPwQzKjxEZMxpszLPH58RK9BPSBkeXUQCFk6CFrsYSQ1PU3xe1NOAf15TlCAAWzGqs-2FzPTnexgLUW8w5QCf5AaIeFnPToTpuf4slMgHhabaZbNa7z4NNeoYXj8w7YyEwpEbb8-2Fy6wUMMgBSpJuHjnwAOafX2egs0o8f-2BDMqUoRxfAivbJah-2Ffhof230ook8YUuhWzVb4aV9okY6u-2BF6ydVoA6kJCQ6A0q7Eq/SGBn), who Facebook once embedded in the Trump campaign to help officials there use the company’s advertising platform. Barnes, who like a growing number of former Facebook employees experienced a crisis of conscience over the work he did there, revealed that the company had made unusual arrangements to ensure Trump could buy the maximum amount of ads:

The profile lays out the extraordinary amount of assistance that Facebook lent Trump. In theory, the same amount of assistance was available to Hillary Clinton, but she declined. Barnes hand-coded custom advertising tools for Trump, ran split tests on advertising copy to see which would be most effective, and offered troubleshooting help whenever asked during what he describes as 12-hour days working on the campaign. He also ensured the company could access a larger line of credit than Facebook had ever previously extended:

*The Trump campaign needed a large credit line from Facebook, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the situation. This issue posed special challenges. Facebook sometimes extends credit to a select group of digital agencies, but Mr. Parscale’s outfit didn’t qualify for a large line because it didn’t have a track record with Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter. The Trump team also wanted to pay for ads with a credit card, but Facebook’s transactions system wasn’t set up to handle payments of as much as $300,000 to $400,000 a day on a credit card, according to Mr. Barnes and others familiar with the matter.*

*As employees looked for ways to address the problem, Mr. Parscale texted Mr. Barnes to say Mr. Trump would go on TV and “say Facebook was being unfair to him” if the issue wasn’t resolved quickly, Mr. Barnes said. Eventually, Facebook came up with a fix.*

Of course, it’s possible that Facebook bent over backwards for Trump for simple reasons of self-preservation. In an environment where regulation seems increasingly likely, a corporation will naturally seek to make nice with any potential nemesis.

Still, the scope of Facebook’s aid to the Trump campaign is surprising. And it gives credence to one of the arguments made forcefully by Cohen: that social networks have been far more successful at empowering dangerous reactionaries than they have more progressive forces.

In most ways, 2019 was a stellar year for Facebook’s business. ([Alex Heath has a nice \[paywalled!\] overview here](http://click.revue.email/mps2/c/2AA/cM9xAA/t.2x1/TYR8wc67T1yUKyHi59Jz8w/h13/Og-2FW-2Fb1JE6shNaGgJUlcFyQE-2Bda2kEksAEM-2FRNQxWAgKUhXLSiE16Gekittv7mZR-2FHJ7orcSmJcmI4zgXYt5B1j1uZOnGGXz2UoJYDWtcD16pxkortStCZnOEjNldtZYOfFrnAwEQPC4-2FZs4KjDNG7OB-2Bpyq2QeCjyFKU-2BuxL1-2BnAi6oQ2JZ2A1yJRPKiJsSEpcYjU2m8g7W7cNvaPhJ4RfbxiKbhNbGyE5yCSdPghuF-2BtB4w4l6yx2L5n4gPOlHFuwS7zshbSoT02-2FGTv25KA-3D-3D/OnIb).) But it was a bad year for Facebook’s reputation. And until the company is held accountable for the misuses of its products in some meaningful way, it’s hard to see how that will improve. I only hope that when regulation comes, policymakers come up with better solutions than Cohen did.",0

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

Ten candidates will be on stage Wednesday for the fifth Democratic presidential debate. That’s two fewer than were onstage for last month’s debate: former Congressman Beto O’Rourke dropped out and another candidate, former HUD Secretary Julián Castro, failed to hit the required polling levels. In order to qualify for this debate, candidates needed to achieve at least 3 percent in four approved polls or at least 5 percent in two early-state polls plus bring in donations from at least 165,000 unique donors.

The fifth Democratic debate is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20 and will be co-hosted by The Washington Post and MSNBC with all female moderators, including MSNBC anchors Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker. The debate will run from 6:00 to 8:00 PM PST.

The debate will air on MSNBC. It can also be streamed live on www.washingtonpost.com.",0

We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread.

t3_dw3sk8,47,"Book Review: Nikki Haley - With All Due Respect
I have now read Nikki Haley's book, *With All Due Respect*. All in all, my respect for Ambassador Haley and the work that she has done remains intact and in some cases has grown.

Despite the book only covering roughly 6-7 years of her career, Haley is both concise and focused. If you're curious on a moment-by-moment basis what a state governor or US ambassador to the UN actually does, you won't find out by reading this book--at least, I didn't get as strong of a sense as I did from reading other memoirs, such as Mattis' *Call Sign Chaos* or Clinton's *What Happened*

In many parts it honestly reads as an extended cover letter for a future job application as President. Job hunters are commonly advised to discuss their professional experience in terms of ""SBI""--""Situation, Behavior, Impact"". Three bullet points: what was the situation, what did you do, and what ultimately came of it? It's hard not to see this exact pattern throughout the book. I don't mean this as a criticism, because Haley might run for President one day and as a prospective voter, I appreciate the format as much as anyone else making a hiring decision.

But Haley doesn't tediously stick to this format--there are also forceful arguments for Haley's vision of policy solutions and reflections on her childhood. Most compelling might be the honest reflection of Haley's empathy and emotional vulnerability. When she writes about the shooting at the Emanuel AME Church, she focuses most of all on the names of the victims, survivors, and families affected, on the funerals for the slain, and on her struggles and occasional failures to remain strong and composed for these people in the face of grief. When she writes about North Korea, the story of Otto Warmbier and his family is clearly foremost in her mind.

Probably the most harrowing part of the book is where she shares the sickening stories of the atrocities of the regime of Salva Kiir in South Sudan. This part ends when Haley manages to swing the Security Council to approve a weapons embargo on South Sudan, but her calm, polite, and direct engagement with Kiir himself is particularly noteworthy.

The biggest issue people have with Haley lately is her defensive comments about President Trump, but in honesty I find these comments no different from those she has made throughout her career. Those of us in the NeverTrump camp who who wanted to see Haley as part of the hashtag-resistance within the administration were probably projecting our own hopes onto her all along. 

First things first: let's address Haley's criticism of Rex Tillerson and John Kelly. I have excerpted enough of it below to provide more context than the clickbait headlines will allow:

&gt; But the fundamental issue wasn’t my cabinet status. The issue was that Rex and the president didn’t agree on much when it came to policy. Rex was more cautious, more in line with the bureaucracy at the State Department and the foreign-policy establishment. I didn’t always agree with the president, either. But I always gave him my opinion honestly I understood that the buck stopped with him. When he made a decision, I would follow it. Rex struggled with the president’s decisions.

&gt; ...KELLY AND TILLERSON CONFIDED IN me that when they resisted the president, they weren’t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country. It was their decisions, not the president’s, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn’t know what he was doing.

&gt; “I don’t even think he realizes what the legislative branch is and that members of Congress are elected by the people,” Kelly said. But it wasn’t the legislative branch that these men wanted the president to defer to; it was them. Tillerson went on to tell me the reason he resisted the president’s decisions was because, if he didn’t, people would die. This was how high the stakes were, he and Kelly told me. We are doing the best we can do to save the country, they said. We need you to work with us and help us do it. This went on for over an hour.

&gt; The problem was, I had been in meetings with the president and Tillerson and Kelly. Their idea of “saving the country” was not stopping a president who they thought was somehow unable to do his job. Their idea of “saving the country” was staying in the Iran Nuclear Deal. Staying in the Paris climate agreement. And keeping the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, just to name a few. These were major policy decisions in which they disagreed with the president. Their obligation in those situations was to express their disagreement to the president. And if they couldn’t change his mind, they needed to carry out his wishes or leave. But that’s not what they were doing.

&gt; .... President Trump, like him or not, won the election. Tillerson and Kelly didn’t. That means something important. What they were doing was disloyal to the president. More important, it was disloyal to the American people who elected him.

&gt; After the election comes the governing, and I knew something about that, too. With public office comes a great responsibility to serve the people. A governor or a president can’t do that if she has people working around her decisions, plotting behind her back, and thinking they are smarter than her. It would have been unbelievably hard for me to govern my state if my chief of staff and members of my cabinet were working to resist me. It’s bad, toxic government that doesn’t serve anyone.

&gt; ... What is at stake is not just the policy agenda of Donald Trump. What is at stake is the U.S. Constitution itself, which places executive authority in the president. No disagreement with the president, no matter how heartfelt, justifies undermining the Constitution.

I read Haley as criticizing Tillerson and Kelly not for personal disloyalty to Donald Trump, but for of their disloyalty to the office and to our democratic form of government. Starting with her public rebuttal of ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration"", Haley has consistently expressed this view that the role of the cabinet and the executive staff is to advise the chief executive and work to implement his or her policies rather than trying to undermine them from the inside.

Even Barack Obama had similar criticisms: [""That's not how our democracy is supposed to work,"" Obama said. ""These people aren't elected ... They're not doing us a favor by actively promoting 90% of the crazy stuff coming out of this White House and saying, 'Don't worry, we're preventing the other 10%.'""](https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-nyt-op-ed-author-trump-resistance-2018-9). Mattis's resignation letter expresses the flip side of this: ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

I respect Haley's position here. I can still understand where Tillerson and Kelly were coming from. Perhaps they saw more of Trump than Haley did--enough that they would be convinced of the need to take extreme measures. There are similar stories from the Nixon administration. But Haley was clearly not convinced, and I don't blame her--especially when it came to obstructing some relatively normal conservative foreign policy decisions.

Speaking of which, Haley also gives a radically different perspective on the Trump administration's foreign policy--and Trump's personal demeanor--than I've seen discussed elsewhere. My impression, even before the sudden withdrawal from northern Syria, was that Trump was wobbly if not outright dovish. Haley instead argues that Trump maintained and intensified economic sanctions on both Russia and North Korea, took a harder stance on Iran, and was more willing than Obama to take principled stands in the United Nations. She even emphasizes the Trump administration's willingness to sell weapons to Ukraine (the book, as written, seems to completely pre-date the current impeachment scandal).

In multiple cases, she refers to the Obama administration's policies as ""appeasement"". In her conclusion:

&gt; The United States is no longer appeasing the terrorist government in Iran or allowing itself to be taken for granted internationally.

Regarding Obama's ""red lines"" on assad's use of chemical weapons, and his unwillingness to enforce them:

&gt; Worst of all, for me, was the fact that the United States was also guilty of appeasing Assad.

Her argument for withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal avoids the ""A-word"" but makes the same basic argument:

&gt; ...making terrible deals with the world’s most vicious regimes is more likely to lead to war. Demonstrating resolve and strength is more likely to avoid war.

In the chapter on North Korea, Haley also invokes the ""A-word"" as she emphasizes the Trump administration's early, more hawkish approach:

&gt; The Trump administration took a fundamentally different approach. The policy of “strategic patience” proclaimed by President Obama was over. We would no longer rely on a policy of appeasement to try to persuade the Kim regime to give up its nuclear program. U.S. presidents had been kicking the can down the road on North Korea for years. There was no longer any road to kick the can down. The new policy came to be called the “maximum pressure” campaign.

She also explicitly states that Trump's bizarre, aggressive comments were literally an instance of madman theory:

&gt; Over the course of the summer, the North Korean missile tests continued, improving in range. And as they did, President Trump and the Kim regime ramped up their rhetoric. In early August, the president infamously said that any more threats from North Korea would be “met with fire, fury, and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.” For the first time, a U.S. president was matching the North Koreans blow for blow. Even some of his rhetoric sounded the same.

&gt; The president’s provocative words were criticized by many, but they actually helped me in my part of the “maximum pressure” strategy....We used it to our advantage. “Tell them you just talked to the president,” President Trump said to me. “Tell them every option is on the table. Make them think I’m crazy.”

&gt; It was what Henry Kissinger called the “madman theory.” I assured the Chinese that I understood their fear. They didn’t want a crisis on the peninsula. I can help you avoid that, I said. But this is what I can’t help you with: I can’t promise you the president won’t act on his own if you don’t work with us.

Haley also doesn't shy away from addressing Trump's more outrageous comments--and what she did in response. She makes it clear that she did not and does not agree with some of Trump's more outrageous gestures towards brutal dictators, but she does attempt to provide some explanation for them:

&gt; I told the president what he had said in the press conference with Putin made me very uncomfortable. The Russians aren’t our friends. They will never be our friends. And you made it sound like we were beholden to them, I said. The president was surprised. No one around him had characterized the press conference in that way. But I was always honest with the president, even when others around him weren’t....

&gt; To his credit, the president soon issued additional remarks, saying he had misspoken and that he accepted U.S. intelligence agencies’ findings about Russian meddling in the election. I was glad he made that clarification, and I understood what he had been trying to do. He was trying to keep communication open with Putin, just as he had with Kim Jong Un and Chinese president Xi Jinping. He liked to deal directly with his negotiating partners. I had seen him work people face-to-face. He had a remarkable ability to disarm them.

Or on Trump's comments seemingly absolving Kim Jong-Un for the death of American tourist Otto Warmbier, and [her own tweet](https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1101148561197158400) in response:

&gt; I knew what the president was doing. He was trying to communicate with Kim without understanding how his words would be taken by the American people and the Warmbier family. I don’t believe he meant any ill will. Still, I knew how Fred and Cindy would take his remarks. I needed to respond before they did....The president walked back his comment about Kim—some. More important, though, in the long term, is that he walked away from the negotiating table in Hanoi rather than give in to the regime’s demands that the sanctions be lifted before North Korea took concrete, irreversible steps toward denuclearization.

Haley even discusses her reaction to Trump's infamous ""good people on both sides"" comment about Charlottesville:

&gt; As I watched the president’s remarks, I was deeply disturbed. I was certain he didn’t understand how damaging his remarks were. But I had been through this. A leader’s words matter in these situations. And the president’s words had been hurtful and dangerous.

&gt; I picked up the phone and called the president. I told him how much Charlottesville reminded me of Charleston, not in the magnitude of the human loss, but in the potential for more violence and more hate. He told me that I had handled the tragedy in Charleston beautifully. What he was experiencing, he said, was not the same thing.

&gt; I replied to the president that the two situations were not really different. They were the same because the pain was the same. There couldn’t be any equivocating about that pain. The Charlottesville marchers’ intention was to create division and hate, just like the Charleston killer. The response to these attempts at division had to be crystal clear. Moral clarity was essential, and the president’s words were not providing that. You have to stop acknowledging the haters, I told the president. You have to understand the power of your voice.

I'm under no illusions that Haley is trying first and foremost to make herself look good. That's a given whenever any politician writes a book. But it should be noted that Haley is defensive of Trump's policies and decisions when and where she agrees with them, and gracefully honest when she doesn't. She makes the case that the Trump administration has achieved some valuable foreign policy goals in a way that I hadn't seen before, but there's no attempt to make Trump come across well in moments like the one above where it's simply not possible for him to. Trump supporters will not find much to criticize in this book, but Trump critics won't find any reason to turn on Nikki Haley that they didn't already have. I'm still not convinced or entirely comfortable with the degree to which Haley does support President Trump, but I can at least see where she's coming from--enough that I can see good faith in it.

At the same time, Haley doesn't hold back on her criticisms of others. Rex Tillerson comes across as a self-important blowhard. Barack Obama also doesn't come across well; aside from the foreign policy differences discussed above, Haley shares a disappointing moment after the Charleston shooting:

&gt; Later, on the day of the murders, the president called me from Air Force One. I had met and spoken with President Obama many times. We had always had what I thought was a cordial relationship. So I was glad to hear from him. When a governor goes through a crisis, you look to your president for support. You look to your president for understanding and partnership.

&gt; From the moment he got on the phone, the president was very short and to the point. There was a coldness in his voice. The president said he was calling about the shooting, but he didn’t offer his condolences. When I told him I was worried about South Carolinians being able to get through the tragedy without violence, he didn’t offer any help or words of encouragement. He seemed to feel the way he had hinted at before—that South Carolinians were partly to blame for the murders. When I hung up the phone, it didn’t feel like we had had a conversation. It felt like President Obama was going through the motions, checking a box. It seemed to me like South Carolina was going to have to go at it alone.

All in all, I appreciated the book and feel that even where I might not agree with Haley, I can still respect her positions. I'd highly recommend the book to anyone who's curious and/or outraged and/or disappointed after the recent media coverage. You might still be disappointed in her, but at least you'll be disappointed from a more informed position. I'm still not entirely sure how I feel; while Haley provides a lot of valuable perspective, oddly enough for a book that just came out, I'm still not sure how exactly to square it with the news of recent weeks. But it's given me a lot to think about.",0

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

t3_dtcrl2,94,"[Effort post] “You Shall Love Your Neighbour As Yourself” As A Compass For Centre-Right Policy
The Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro claimed \[1\]:

&gt;There are many reasons \[why Western civilization has been so successful\], but the best place to start is with the teachings and philosophies that emerged from two ancient cities: Jerusalem and Athens. Jerusalem represents religious revelation as manifested in the Judeo-Christian tradition: the beliefs that a good God created an ordered universe and that this God demands moral behavior from His paramount creation, man.

For the sake of discussion, in this essay Shapiro’s claim shall be assumed to be true.

One of the most important principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition is “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” \[2\] \[3\].

The “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” principle should be a compass for centre-right policy as the core principles of centre-right ideology are predicated on this principle. During World War II, Nazi Germany and its collaborators performed the Holocaust—the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jews \[4\]. After the Allies won World War II, the then newly established United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, stating that “disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind” \[5\]. The very concept of events such as the Holocaust being “barbarous” and “\[outraging\] the conscience of mankind” is predicated on the assumption that mankind should “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” which has its roots in “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” \[6\]. In 1983, the centre-right International Democrat Union (IDU) proclaimed in their Principles that they are to be “committed to advancing the social and political values on which democratic societies are founded, including the basic personal freedoms and human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” and to “\[reject\] any form of totalitarianism, which brings so much suffering and restricts so many freedoms today” \[7\]. Centre-right ideology is therefore based on the concept of human rights predicated on the “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” principle, and hence the principle should be a compass for centre-right policy.

If the centre-right adopts the “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” principle as a compass for centre-right policy, the centre-right must first condemn and not associate with all parties which embrace love’s opposite—hate as the basis for all they do. That should include condemning and not associating with bonafide race-supremacist groups and actual neo-Nazis, but should also encompass condemning and not associating with the Southern Poverty Law Centre (wrongfully applied the term hate group to legitimate organizations under the guise of civil rights out of hate against the right \[8\]) and radical Communists (hate against capitalists and rich people).

The centre-right should also start directing policy towards genuinely empowering (instead of blindly helping) the disadvantaged of society. Blindly helping the disadvantaged of society through handouts keeps them vulnerable and shortchanges them, but empowering them helps them stand on their own feet, and that is true loving your neighbour as yourself (Would you rather remain vulnerable or would you rather be empowered?). For example, the centre-right should start making education and jobs training a greater priority than welfare handouts.

I understand that the “You shall love your neighbour as yourself” principle should not be the only compass for centre-right policy; it should be one of the centre-right’s core principles. However I hope that adopting this principle helps direct the centre-right and the country towards true progress.

\[2\] Leviticus 19:17–18 states (English Standard Version):

&gt;\[And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, “\]You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly with your neighbor, lest you incur sin because of him. You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.

\[3\] Mark 12:28–31 states (English Standard Version):

&gt;And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”

Would something like premium support (akin to Switzerland) or publicly funded vouchers linked to HSAs end up working out for them? At the same time, does this issue speak to a much larger problem, namely, a gap between the poor (who at least have help with public aid but most likely still struggle day to day), the working class (who seem to be in a similar situation but less likelier to get public assistance though are probably doing better but still struggle) and those who are within a more comfortably middle class status especially in HCOL areas where chances are even the middle if not upper middle class are struggling to get by?

While still costly and expensive at up to $500 billion a year, couldn't Medicare Extra serve as a more realistic alternative for Medicare for All while providing coverage for those in need like the uninsured? Meanwhile, would a larger block grant for the Health Care Choices idea make it much more workable by giving more resources for the states to enact their own health care policies, like let's say, re-consolidating current health care spending like the premium tax credits and the exchange subsidies and adding another $365 billion which while also a huge sum would help work towards coverage for all and make our system somewhat similar to Canada (I believe they also have a scheme where the provinces get support for their systems)?",0

The article I'm addressing is:

https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/08/07/sheriffs-office-hit-with-corruption-probe-over-concealed-weapons-permits/

Hi Robert,

I noticed your coverage of the Smith CCW corruption scandal was pretty good, but it wasn't complete.  There's some things I know about this that would blow your mind.

Such as, the *NRA* helped engineer a cover-up of this problem all the way back in 2002, and I can prove it:

https://youtu.be/cPDZjQAHeY0

I married and took my wife's last name in 2013 but that's me in the video.

The reason for the NRA's position?  Too many of the sheriffs doing this stuff including Baxter Dunn of San Joaquin county (later imprisoned), Mike Carona in Orange County (also imprisoned) and sheriffs in Sacramento, Alameda, Contra Costa and elsewhere were Republicans.  The GOP leadership in Sacramento was counting on sheriffs (often the only county-level GOP office holder) to move up to the legislature, necessary due to term limits.  And here I was exposing their corruption to their gun owner base.

I don't know of anybody else tossed out of the NRA for being too radical.

The problem of illicit sales of gun carry status is national in scope.  Somebody died over it in Tulsa OK a few years back.  A cluster of insanity in Oakley MI involved some pro ball players and Kid Rock of all people... That was about the sale of actual law enforcement credentials.  Under a 2004 federal law called LEOSA anybody with a law enforcement badge can carry in all 50 states plus DC, Guam, etc.  So instead of a single fat cat bribing cops in multiple states for carry permits, he only needs to bribe one for national carry rights.

That's what led to a 72 year old idiot in Tulsa out playing cops with a real gun one weekend a year shooting somebody who didn't need shooting.

New York City is infamous for carry permit bribery.  A group inside the NYPD selling them was busted in 2017.  One of the imprisoned cops in that case says that one of the bribers (is that a word?) was one Donald J Trump.

Michael Cohen is saying the same thing, and he also holds a very rare NYC carry permit.

This is also something the NRA is hoping never gets out as it will kill Trump's support among gun owners.

If you'd like a guided tour down this rabbit hole, drop me a line.  I'll tell you now though, both the left and right will hate it.  The right because they're mostly the ones doing this shit, the left because it blows a gaping hole in the entire phrase ""sensible gun control"".

One idea I like in particular is to blend UCC with universalized [CHCs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolynmcclanahan/2012/07/16/community-health-centers-providing-a-base-of-care/) (Community Health Center), wouldn't they end up complimenting each other pretty well?

It seems like these questions should be answered by legislature, not by court that (supposedly) comes to decision by deciphering a 250-year old document. It seems that sometimes legislature is afraid to give a definite answer and defers decision to these augurs. So, what do you think? Should SCOTUS stay the same or should something about it change?",0

I wrote about this topic before but do you think bailing out the exchanges with federal subsidies can help reform and save P.P.A.C.A? For example, wasn't one of the premises/reasons for a problematic implementation was a lack of people paying into the exchanges compared to people using health care benefits (someone on Quora pointed out that two parts of the law, allowing kids to stay on their parents's plan until 26 and Medicaid Expansion ended up messing that up)? 

I know policy and administration isn't so simple but what about this? There's about 30 million (and more) who are uninsured; hypothetically, what if we gave them a voucher to help cover or defray the cost of an insurance plan, perhaps partially when they can pay in but at a more affordable rate, would that begin to help reverse the problems within the exchanges and reform them? 

For example, let's say we gave 30 million people, $4,800 vouchers (covering up $400 in premiums), totaling $144,000,000 (rounding up to $150)  wouldn't that help bring a ton of people in the exchanges? 

Or why not use that amount of money to set up a national high risk pool or even with a large amount like that, the pool would still get overloaded due to having a population with disproportionate health care needs? 

This said, I read that there's a similar plan from two of the President candidates that can covered all legal residents and citizens with a similar costs ($130 billion) which seem a way to go. Your thoughts?",0

This is data collected over 1000 submissions and all reachable comments within those submissions using python and the praw library for the Reddit API.

Notes:

In the two users pages, pdeleted just means ""possibly deleted"". There was no [author.name](https://author.name) available for these.

Any tab without ""Karma"" (""FlairCount"" for example) was a simple increment (+1) count.

""Karma"" tabs are found by adding all karma together for the group.

""Favored Domain"" is a karma count.

""UserToFlair"" is a simple mapping of usernames to flair. Could be helpful for tables.

A conclusion: Around 38% of all flaired users are somewhere on the left end of the spectrum (Left Visitor + the few other explicitly left flairs not caught in the cleanup + a few custom flaired users) if we go by flair definitions. In all likelihood this number is actually quite a bit larger due to how the word ""Liberal"" is included in flairs that are ostensibly Center-Right as well as some users trying to hide as right of center. As of the time of collection only 2,550 users were flaired with any kind of flair out of the 9,880 total users and we can only guess what their leanings are due to their not being able to comment, though with the voting patterns there are some guesses that can be made.",0

Some people claim that Mitch McConnell would retire from being a majority speaker assuming Republicans keep control of the Senate, or if they become the minority, he could still retire or give up his leadership role. I imagine this would be a strong opportunity for someone like Mitt Romney to become a majority/minority leader and be a big voice for Republicans. I really doubt he would run for President in 2024 because of his age and instead would prefer to lead Republicans in the Senate.

I imagine post-trump, People like John Kasich, Charlie Baker, Larry Hogan gain more clout. I also could see Paul Ryan returning or some conservative folks like Ben Sasse or Dan Crenshaw rising.

I am not sure, where Republicans would change on policy, maybe they would not be as protectionist and would at least attempt to appear like they have moral clarity post-trump. 

I also don't know how Fox News and Conservative Media plays into this because most of them have criticized the people I have named above and if Donald Trump loses reelection or is impeached/convicted, then its hard to see these people have any credibility since they spent the past few years defending Trump and attacking all those who criticized him.",0

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

t3_ddiinq,55,"The Pirate Skiff Comes Ashore (Jonah Goldberg's G-File)
Dear Reader (especially those of you who stayed with me in the wilderness lo, these last five months),
 
This is the last G-File [pause for dramatic effect]…of this era of professional limbo I’ve been in. By this time next week, this “news”letter will be a product of [Name Redacted]. Before I continue, let me just say thank you to the tens of thousands of you who signed up for this thing when I left National Review to start this endeavor with Steve Hayes and Toby Stock (Toby’s the suit, so it’s okay if you haven’t heard of him).
 
They’re both super guys, but they’re Midwesterners, and I find some of that stuff rubbing off on me. For example, prior to spending so much time with Hayes, I don’t think I used “super” as an adjective—outside of conversations about comic books or physics or quoting Fargo (“you’re a super lady”)—more than a couple times a year since I was a kid. Now I find myself using it to describe good meals, smart people, nice days, etc. There are other signs as well. I feel more shame about cursing, and I feel a strange, salmon-like urge to find a good Kroger when shopping for food. They’re super, don’t you know? And so is ranch dressing, which I’ve discovered is good on everything.




**The Audacity of Ope**
 
Speaking of Midwestern stuff, I’ve always had a soft spot for Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. A Tea Party guy back before the grifters and scammers got into it like so many ants in the Jell-O salad at a Wauwatosa fish fry, he came to Washington to bring the commonsense Midwestern values of a churchgoing businessman to Washington. He sincerely believed we need to live within our means, defend the Constitution and—apparently—hector and cajole the Chinese Communist Party to [target the president’s](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/03/ron-johnson-ok-trump-asking-china-investigate-bidens/3855795002/) domestic political opponents.
 
That was an [ope moment](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Ope) for me.  





**Some Turds Will Never Sparkle**
 
So let’s just say it: What Trump did yesterday was, simply, indefensible. It is indefensible from any angle and any distance. As Steve Hayes might say at a Racine’s Best Kringle Contest, “Where to begin?”
 
China doesn’t have due process, the rule of law, or human rights as we understand them. People are executed, put in prison, put in camps, and put in prison camps for political infractions or simply practicing the wrong faith. It would be outrageous if Trump publicly called for the United Kingdom or Holland to investigate one of his political opponents without going through proper channels, but at least those countries have legal systems where we can have some faith in the justice of the outcome. But China? China!?
 
Moreover, the United States and China are in the middle of intense trade negotiations, and the president cavalierly throws out the fact that there’s something else he wants from the Chinese. He doesn’t have to say quid pro quo. The whole context is shot through with quid-pro-quo-y-ness (quid-pro-quosity?).
 
It is particularly gobsmacking in the context of the relentless push from the MAGA nationalists who’ve been determined to make China our new existential foe for the 21st century. This conflicts with their core mission of perpetual turd-polishing. So, the new nationalists cry: “The Chinese are evil!” “The Chinese are our enemy!” “The Chinese are a corrupt technocratic kakocracy!” But also: “Thank you president Trump for asking the Chinese to get the truth about Joe Biden!”
 
This is not nationalism. This is Trumpism, where the needs of the nation and the state are subsumed into the president’s personal desires. Nationalists don’t wear T-shirts that read “I’d rather be a Russian than a Democrat” and they don’t exhort foreign tyrants to do their dirty work against domestic political opponents.
 
I wonder if when you get your America First membership card, buried deep in the user agreement is the language that specifies *Except when the President’s political foes can best be taken out by the ChiComs.*
 
It’s also politically indefensible. First of all, all of the people who tried valiantly—and unpersuasively—to defend Trump’s “Russia, if you’re listening” line as merely a joke are left standing three feet off a cliff like Wile E. Coyote before he starts to plummet. He certainly wasn’t joking yesterday. He wasn’t joking when he told George Stephanopoulos that he saw no problem taking foreign opposition research. He wasn’t joking when he asked for that “favor” from Zelensky.
 
But let’s say you just don’t care about any of the high-minded stuff or the hypocrisy. You just want Trump to keep “winning.” But will his agenda—whatever that is—be advanced? Infrastructure week, long the “Free Beer Tomorrow” of American politics, is now the political equivalent pie in the sky. Does this expand Trump’s coalition? Does it make it more or less likely he’s impeached?
 
“Aha! Right!” you might respond. That’s his genius. He’s making the Democrats impeach him and the constant whining and moral outrage against impeachment is a ruse. After all, if you’ve been watching, reading, or listening to the usual suspects, impeachment will be good for Trump and the GOP and a “disaster” for the Democrats.
 
“Trolling” has evolved—or, rather, devolved—as an internet term over the last few years. But not long ago, there was a common phrase called “concern-trolling.” It means to pretend to be very worried about the well-being of your political opponents. It was once a staple of the Washington Post op-ed page. “I want two vibrant and healthy parties,” some liberal columnist might write, “and that’s why I am worried that the GOP’s pro-life position will cripple it in the long run.”
 
These days, it is amazing how many of my friends on the right are suddenly very, very, concerned about what the Democrats are doing to themselves. It’s almost like they’re reassuring the audience that this storyline will end well.
 
That doesn’t mean they’re wrong. This could blow up in the Democrats’ faces. But most of right-wing media these days seems really eager to talk about pretty much anything other than what Trump has said or done. 





**The Whistleblower Doesn’t Matter Anymore**

And there’s perhaps no one they want to talk about more than the Whistleblower, except for Adam Schiff, who, let the record show, is a dishonest and partisan hack whose only impressive quality is his ability to mask his hackery in the dulcet and somber tones of concern-trollery.
 
I keep seeing clips of right-wingers from shows I don’t watch ranting about the Whistleblower as if the case against Trump still hinges on that person’s motivations and credibility.
 
The really unhinged folks call him or her a deep state operative, spy, saboteur, etc. The calmer folks say the Whistleblower is a “leaker.” All of these terms are wrong, if the facts as reported are true (admittedly a potentially big if). Even if she/he approached Schiff’s staff to ask for guidance, that doesn’t make him/her a liar—it does make Schiff a liar, but we knew that.
 
At some point, we need to hear directly from the whistleblower. But the inconvenient fact is that most of the allegations in the report have already been corroborated. Trump says, ""This is an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, taken by very talented stenographers.” His insistence on this point would make me suspect it’s not an exact transcript—even if it didn’t say in the document that this “is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”
 
But if you take Trump at his word, that it is a verbatim transcript, then the need to confront the whistleblower—never mind roll out the electric chair for the traitor—unravels considerably.
 
The transcript supports three out of four of the whistleblowers allegations: Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden, Trump asked for Zelensky’s help to investigate the fantastical—and Putin helpful—tale of the missing server in Ukraine, and Trump wanted Zelensky to work with Giuliani, as the whistleblower alleged. And this leaves out all of the things Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump have confessed to by now.
 
The reason they want the whistleblower exposed is pretty obvious: Trump and his defenders are weakest when they have to defend Trump’s behavior or some principle (see [my column today](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/trump-defenders-have-adopted-a-doctrine-of-infallibility/)). They are most effective when they can destroy someone else. That’s what Trump enjoys and that’s what more and more of his fans enjoy too. The cruelty is the sauce. 




**The New Reformers!**
 
Oh, and spare me the “We need to know what happened in 2016” stuff. I have no problem with the Durham investigation. And before I jump on the anti-Bill Barr bandwagon, I want to know more about what he actually did, rather than the spin that’s being put on it. But this is not the way you launch a proper investigation. This is not the way you talk about a proper investigation. This is the way you float a trial balloon to a fairly hostile foreign government that sees everything through a transactional prism: “Please ratf*ck my opponent, I’ll make it worth your while.”
 
Seriously, all I ask is that people stop working from the assumption that we’re all idiots. You’ve got clowns going on cable news nightly pretending that Trump was constitutionally and legally obligated to raise the Biden case with the Ukrainian president. Seriously, I heard one guy suggest that if he hadn’t importuned Zelensky to investigate Biden, that would be impeachable. 
For God’s sake, just shhh.
 
In the past, when I would point out that Donald J. Trump (First of His Name, Chancellor of Trump University, Regent of the Taj Mahal Casino, Ponzi Czar of the Trump Network, Admitted Lord of the Swamp, Heroic Victor of the Eminent Domain Wars, Overseer of the Trump Foundation [discontinued], Master of the Strategic Bankruptcy and Defender of the Money-Laundering Oligarchs, Servant of the Saudis and Exposer of JFK’s True Murderer) was a shady guy, his defenders would say that’s what they liked about him; he knew how the swamp worked and he would use that knowledge to Make America Great Again. And now the same people are appalled at the suggestion that he isn’t a passionate enemy of corruption everywhere? 




**About The Other Side **
 
My friend Tim Alberta tweeted:
 
Barack Obama stands in front of the White House. With the entire world watching, he declares, “China should start an investigation into the Romneys.” Republicans wouldn’t just call for impeachment. They would call for charges of treason.”
 
To which a fellow who goes by the name “Orange Muppet Energy” replied:
 
And the blue checkmark flying journo squad would be explaining how it's actually entirely reasonable while two months later insisting that the tan suit was his only scandal. Just as they did with every other scandal. Everyone involved is sh*t.
 
I largely agree with both tweets, even if I think the second is too exonerating of Trump. The scenario with Obama is a hypothetical, while Trump’s behavior actually happened. The probably accurate suspicion that the media and the Democrats would behave as badly—or just almost as badly—as many Republicans and media conservatives are behaving now isn’t an excuse. But it is part of an explanation. It took a long time to get us here, and pretty much everyone deserves some portion of blame (including me).
 
I’ll write more about that another time, but suffice it to say, I’m dedicating a big chunk of the rest of my life to trying to do something about it.
 
Stay tuned. 




**Various &amp; Sundry**
 
Canine Update: The girls are doing great. They were very happy to see us when we got home last Sunday, but truth be told they were happier to see the Fair Jessica. This confuses some people because they see so many of my videos walking the beasts, scritching the beasts, giving the beasts treats, etc. But this is a nice case study in how media can distort things by giving less than the whole picture. My wife works mostly from home, and so she spends a lot more time with the doggers. She takes them on the truly epic adventures on the weekends. She also feeds them most of their meals—though I do my share. The problem is that she doesn’t record them. I’m open to the idea this is a failing on her part, but one of the reasons the dog videos are so much fun is that dogs don’t care about celebrity. They do care about lost balls, though. Stick-ups are a concern as well.
 
Anyway, Zoë and Pippa seem to be enjoy each other’s company more than ever. There was a time when this schnozzle-tush smash-up could have resulted in a fight. Zoë continues to let Pip chase her in ways she never did before. Some people were concerned that Zoë started to play too rough in this video, and it’s true, she did. Zoë’s a bit like the Hulk. In Bruce Banner mode, she can have lots of fun. But if she gets too excited, she starts to turn metaphorically green and goes into “smash”—or, in this case, “chomp”—mode. Pippa seems to understand that the best way to respond to this is to basically play dead on her back.
 
Oh, one last thing. Someone insulted Pippa on Twitter and I responded with a fairly juvenile retort. That’s not important. What I really liked was the way folks rallied to her defense. Some of the replies are awesome.",0

Could they be transferred into a stick to encourage better treatment of Hong Kong. It gives the President a way out right before the election.

t3_das2j9,57,"Liberalism and It's Malcontents (Jonah Goldberg's G-File)
 Dear Reader (including all the haters and losers who are angry that I dared to have a good time on my podcast), 

[I wrote a column](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/09/trump-impeachment-question-president-public-trust/) arguing that I think the allegations against Trump are true and that they’re impeachable, but I am less sure that he should be impeached for it. And just as I predicted in the first sentence, no one likes my take. 

But I really don’t want to write about Trump or Ukraine or whether the transcript is white and gold or blue and black—oh wait, that was that dress. But the argument feels the same. 

Instead, I want to write about impeachment and how it might illuminate the still smoldering French-Ahmari wars. Will I succeed in the amount of words I have available to me? Let’s find out.

As I keep saying, echoing everyone from James Madison to Andy McCarthy, impeachment isn’t a criminal or legalistic mechanism. It’s a political one. That’s why Madison passionately opposed having the Supreme Court handle impeachment trials. The Chief Justice may preside over impeachment, but it’s the Senate that acts as the real judge and jury. 

Criminal acts are obviously impeachable, but so are all manner of perfectly legal acts as well. Prior to the 25th amendment, if the president went bonkers and only wanted to spend his days eating cat food, the only way to get him out of there was to impeach him. There’s nothing illegal about spending all your time eating cat food, but it’s not something we look for in a commander- in-chief. If the president started saying that he kind of thinks ISIS has the better argument and that we should be aiding it every way we can, I can imagine some people wanting to impeach him. That’s because, as Andy has written many times, impeachment is ultimately about remedying a breach of trust with the American people. 

Let’s stay on that for a second. Let’s imagine the president—and I don’t mean Trump, but any president—announced shortly after being elected that he had actually been a secret Muslim all along. Would that be impeachable? Yes. Should he be impeached for it? Well, that’s a subject for debate. There’s nothing illegal about or wrong with being a Muslim. Lying about it is a problem, but maybe he or she had a good reason. If the newly elected president were a truly radical Muslim with sympathies for terror groups—again, nothing illegal there—I suspect that president would be and should be impeached. But if this president were just a peaceful and patriotic Muslim (like the majority of American Muslims are), I think the case for impeachment is much, much weaker. Why not just wait and see what the president does and let the voters render their verdict in four years?

Now imagine it’s not 2020 but 1920 or even 1820. My hunch is that this wouldn’t even be up for debate. Articles of impeachment would fly out of Congress like an angry cat out of a clothes dryer. Forget being a Muslim. Imagine it’s the 1850s, during the height of the Know Nothing era, and a newly sworn-in president revealed that he was a Catholic. Hearings on whether someone could be president and loyal to the Pope in Rome would start the next morning.

Again, there’s nothing illegal about being Catholic ([sorry Jimmy Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Amendment)). And while it might say something unpleasant about America that people would want to impeach a president for being Catholic (or, back then, secretly mixed-race), there’s nothing stopping Congress from impeaching a president for any damned thing it wants, including violations of cultural norms or moral taboos. 

This is one of the things that always bothered me about the Clinton impeachment. Because we treat the law as a kind of secular theology, the Lewinsky scandal was contorted into a perfectly legalistic affair. Whether or not Clinton should have been impeached is a complicated argument with pros and cons on each side. But the idea that his conduct in the Oval Office—while perfectly legal—wasn’t impeachable always struck me as absurd. ([Judge Bork agreed with me, by the way.](https://www.nationalreview.com/1998/09/heeeeeeeees-back-greta-van-awful-jonah-goldberg/))  

One of the funny things about how people have changed in the last two decades is that back then, religious conservatives were adamant about this point and feminists were outraged by it. Now, if we had a replay of the same fact pattern, in the wake of Trump and #MeToo, the arguments would also surely be completely reversed. 




**Liberalism in Theory and Practice**

So what does this have to do with the rolling bar fight on the right about liberalism and nationalism (or post-liberalism or Catholic Integralism or whatever)?

[In the latest issue of National Affairs,](https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/liberal-practice-v-liberal-theory) Daniel Burns has a terrific essay cutting through a lot of the noise in this debate. He points out that one of the reasons it’s so frustrating is that both sides are largely talking past each other. He writes:

&gt;Many good-faith misunderstandings within these debates can be traced to an ambiguity in the term ""liberalism."" It refers, on the one hand, to a set of political practices, and on the other hand, to a political theory that purports to explain those practices. Defenders of liberalism are thinking first and foremost about liberal political practice, which they (almost all) defend by drawing selectively on liberal theory. Critics of liberalism are thinking first and foremost about liberal political theory, which they (almost all) attack by pointing selectively to liberal practice.

&gt;These attacks and these defenses share a common error. Both accept liberal theory's false claim to be the authoritative interpreter of liberal practice. The critics of liberalism are right to see liberal theory as fatally flawed: It cannot explain the workings of any real human society. But precisely because it is so flawed, liberal theory also cannot explain the weaknesses of our own liberal societies.

Burns makes a crucial distinction that is at the heart of [my book,](https://jonahgoldberg.com/suicide-of-the-west/) but he manages to distill it perhaps better than I did. Liberal theory as articulated by Locke, Kant, Mills, et al. is a very different thing from liberalism as a cultural phenomenon. We live in a liberal society—rule of law, private property, equal rights, etc.—but many of our rules and institutions can find no support in liberal theory. 

“For example,” Burns writes, “federalism as Americans know it has no place in liberal theory. Liberal theory demands the strict sovereignty of the entire (unitary) populace. No one has ever shown how to reconcile this demand with a partially sovereign national union under a government of enumerated powers, where the remainder of sovereignty is reserved to 50 subordinate communities whose governments have no jurisdiction over one another.” He adds that “a federal government of enumerated powers is an American innovation at odds with Locke's whole view of government.” And he’s right.

More relevant to the discussion above, he also notes that:

&gt;Liberal theory also demands strict government neutrality in religious matters. Precisely zero liberal countries have ever followed this demand or even made a consistent effort to do so. Many liberal countries have formally established national religions. The rest have not needed any formal establishment to have their laws visibly shaped by their citizens' widely shared religious views.

In Suicide of the West, I argue that Locke and all the ideas we tend to associate with him (the “Lockean Revolution”) was a lagging indicator rather than a starter’s pistol. Liberalism was an emergent property that emanated out of specific—very weird—English culture. This doesn’t mean those ideas weren’t important. They were vital in validating, rationalizing, and ultimately expanding liberal principles even further. But without a liberal culture to support it, liberal theory has no power. It’s the same with the Constitution. The only power the Constitution has is derived entirely from the public’s investment of authority in it. If, by magic or hypnosis, all Americans woke up tomorrow morning hating the Constitution, they wouldn’t need to repeal it. We’d all just ignore it. Politicians would violate its principles with abandon and, because no voters complained, there would be no penalty. 

This points to the weird contradictions in the nationalism vs. liberalism debate. The nationalists, like devotees of the liberal theory they detest, want (at least rhetorically) to treat the whole country as a singular polity where no one, anywhere, has a right to live wrong. With the partial exception of Patrick Deneen, whose book is better than its summarizers often realize, arguments for federalism, localism, and the sovereignty of private businesses and institutions seem to fall by the wayside. Meanwhile, the advocates of liberalism often invoke the importance of federalism, localism, etc., which have little or no support in liberal theory. 

David French is a classical liberal. But he’s also a conservative. The same goes for me. And there are important, often healthy, tensions between the two. That’s why I’ve long argued that conservatism is more than merely classical liberalism, but a conservatism that doesn’t conserve classical liberalism isn’t worth conserving. 

But I need to update that argument. Because what also needs to be conserved isn’t just classical liberalism as a theoretical construct (as flawed as it may be), but also liberal culture, which is more than just liberal theory. 

I don’t think Trump’s crazy tweets and other rhetorical attacks on various norms and institutions are impeachable, any more than I thought George W. Bush’s admission that he was signing a law even though he believed it was unconstitutional in parts was impeachable. But I would rather live in a country where there was a robust discussion about whether impeachment was warranted. 

Again, put Trump aside. The way we talk about impeachment as a purely legalistic mechanism reflects the way we’ve lost a certain amount of cultural confidence and cohesion. Some of that loss isn’t necessarily bad. I wouldn’t want to live in a country where we impeached someone solely because of faith or ancestry. But I do want to live in a country where we hold our leaders to standards greater than mere technical fidelity to the law.

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

Dear Reader (including all of you who insist on novelty in these “Dear Reader” gags),
 
The [“Whistleblower” story could be huge](https://thebulwark.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dni-the-ig-and-the-whistleblower-report/), or it could be a nothingburger, or it could be something in between. And I’m wary of competing in the race to be wrong first.
 
But that’s the world we live in these days. Every five minutes, someone fires a starter pistol to get everyone bolting out of the blocks toward whatever conclusion best suits their priors—or their marching orders. Then hours or days later, it turns out to have been a false start.
 
It’s like the writers of LOST and The Sopranos collaborated on the script of this timeline. Major plot developments seem destined to explode only to fizzle, leaving the audience to ask, “What was the deal with that smoke monster?” or, “What ever happened to the Russian in the Pine Barrens?”




**Sunday, Sunday, Sunday**
 
Forget all of the hopes and fears people invested in the Mueller probe. Just consider what has happened since last Sunday.
 
 A New York Times story about Brett Kavanaugh seemed to be greasing the skids for the impeachment of a Supreme Court Justice, and by Wednesday the Washington Post was reporting the Democrats were shouting “Run Away!” [like a scene out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FPELc1wEvk)  
 
Also on Sunday, Trump was tweeting we were “locked and loaded” for retaliation against Iran for the drone attack in Saudi Arabia. [All we were waiting for was orders from the Saudis,](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1173368423381962752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1173368423381962752&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2019%2F09%2F17%2Fsaudi-arabia-oil-field-attack-trump%2F) because when Trump “leads from behind” and/or genuflects to the Saudis, it’s manly and America First-y, unlike when Obama does it in squishy globalist fashion. But by [Monday,](https://bdnews24.com/world/2019/09/17/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities) Trump was saying he was in “no rush” and didn’t want war. In those 24 hours, countless pundits and partisans ran from one position to another like Scooby and the Gang running from some ghost in a haunted mansion.
 
This constant zig-zagging is unsettling all by itself. But the accompanying riots of hypocrisy that come with it, as people instantaneously ratchet up their indignation and lock down their talking points, makes the whole spectacle of our politics a Rorschach test in which the blots keep morphing like the globules in a lava lamp.
 
I’m struggling to put my finger on what bothers me most about this atmosphere. But I think it’s the way combatants on all sides act like it’s outrageous to suggest that the story might not be what they want it to be. Everyone is like Charlton Heston shouting, “You can have my narrative when you pry it from my cold dead hands!”
 
I don’t know if Trump offered an indefensible quid pro quo to the Ukrainians in order to get them to dig up dirt on Biden. I also don’t know if there’s legitimate dirt to be found. Both things are possible, together or separately. And if there is dirt on Biden, that wouldn’t exonerate Trump if he did what some allege. It is not outrageous to think any of these scenarios is possible or even plausible.  
 
For instance, I laughed very hard when Donald Trump tweeted this about the whistleblower story:
 
&gt;*[Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially ‘heavily populated’ call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1174696521914339328)*
 
This is a work of art in the categories of fan service and gaslighting alike. If you think Trump might say something inappropriate on a phone call with a foreign leader, that doesn’t make you dumb, it makes you minimally observant. This is a guy who, while wired for sound, told Billy Bush about how he likes to sexually assault women. [Just this week, he tried to get a military official to detail the secret surveillance technology in his wall prototype at a press conference.](https://www.mediaite.com/opinion/watch-border-wall-chief-engineer-tells-trump-to-stop-blabbing-about-secret-surveillance-tech/) In a private meeting, he railed about sh*thole countries in front of Democrats who probably pulled their hamstrings rushing out to leak it. [He blurted out highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister.](https://www.mediaite.com/online/new-wapo-report-says-trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-ambassador-foreign-minister/) [At a press conference in Helsinki, he inappropriately took Vladimir Putin’s side against the American intelligence community.](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/17/629601233/trumps-helsinki-bow-to-putin-leaves-world-wondering-whats-up) The whole reason he isn’t in the impeachment dock right now, as the Mueller report and Corey Lewandowski’s recent testimonies attest, is that his aides know not to follow through when he “inappropriately” tells them bat guano crazy things. 
 
The point is that Trump says whackadoo stuff constantly, and he expects his praetorians to defend it right up until the moment he decides to backtrack. For instance, again on Sunday, he [tweeted,](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1173371482812162048) “The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, 'No Conditions.' That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).”
 
[The thing is: Trump has said numerous times, including on camera, that he would gladly meet with the Iranians with no preconditions.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lashed-out-at-the-media-for-reporting-he-would-meet-with-iran-with-no-conditions-hes-said-as-much-on-camera-twice/2019/09/16/f71a98e2-d86d-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html)
 
Forget how exhausting it is to argue with people who ascribe deep strategic genius to all of these zig-zags. The far more draining experience is to argue with people who seem to deliberately have the long-term memory of a fruit fly, instantaneously taking Trump’s word for it every time he calls something “fake news.” The old narrative was that Trump was a man of peace, eager to negotiate with anybody without preconditions. Then, when he calls this narrative a lie, the same people who believed the old narrative are outraged by anyone who refuses to forget the old one along with them.                    





**The Kavanaugh Cock-up**
 
Since we’re on the subject of narrative maintenance, I suppose I should say a few words about the Kavanaugh story, starting with the fact that it’s a story.
 
When the Rolling Stone rape fraternity story broke a while back, I was one of the first to call b.s. on it. One of my great regrets is that I let a friend talk me out of writing that column a week earlier, even though I was pretty confident in my skepticism. Regardless, the response from a lot of people on the left was, “How dare you suggest these things don’t happen.”
 
My response was, “I never said ‘these things’ don’t happen. I said this didn’t happen. This story is not believable. These alleged facts don’t seem like facts.” (I’m paraphrasing several dozen arguments.)
 
[As I wrote almost exactly a year ago,](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/kavanaugh-testimony-anger-real-person/) the original Kavanaugh drama was essentially an allegory, in which the characters weren’t actually people, but avatars or totems for categories of people. For Martha Nussbaum, Maureen Dowd, and countless others, Kavanaugh was a stand-in for White Male Entitlement.
 
I absolutely believe guys in college and high school do stupid stuff—and stuff far worse than stupid. Forget “believe”; I know it. I also know that white men can feel entitled to things they shouldn’t feel entitled to. But the argument that ""some people do bad things, therefore this person did what he’s accused of"" is anatomically indistinguishable from textbook bigotry and lynch mob logic. “We all know that Jews do X. This person is a Jew and he’s been accused of X. Therefore I believe the accusers.”
 
That’s not how it’s supposed to work.
 
Now, sure, hearsay and rumor are kinds of evidence, at least outside a court of law. But even in journalism and politics, they are rightly considered very low and unreliable forms of evidence. In fact, for journalists and detectives, they’re called “leads”—things that might guide someone toward actual facts or things that might not pan out at all.
 
The disgusting thing—or at least one of them—about the Kavanaugh smear is that leads are being used as substitutes for facts. And when one bit of innuendo, rumor, or hearsay proves to be shaky, instead of disappearing, it’s propped up by another morsel of the same stuff. The Ramirez story was the purest garbage, intended to shore up the weaknesses in Ford’s story. So in order to bolster that, the Times’ writers slapped on yet more garbage:
 
&gt;We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; **the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.**
 
Most of the food fight this week has focused, understandably, on the bit in bold, because it wasn’t in the original New York Times piece and had to be added on later, only after Mollie Hemingway pointed out that the supposed victim has told people she has no recollection of such an event and has not been interviewed. This hasn’t stopped many outlets from referring to her as a “victim,” even in stories about the Times’ screw-up. In other words, even when discussing how the evidence is lacking, the narrative is maintained.
 
But too little public discussion has centered on the absurdity of the story itself.
 
Look, I’m a sophisticated “news”letter writer. At least two of my belts are made of real leather, and even when I was in college, I waited for the bathroom to be available even if there were no dishes in the sink. So I don’t like wallowing in this kind of sordid stuff. Moreover, I paid my dues on this kind of beat 20 years ago arguing about the priapic presidency of Bill Clinton. So I have very little desire to write about Brett Kavanaugh’s gavel, as it were.
 
Let me also say that I loathe identity politics and I don’t like speaking for whole categories of people based solely on their race, gender, or class. But I’ve talked to a large number of middle-aged straight white guys over the last week, and grabbing dudes by their junk is just not done. I am fairly certain that if I grabbed Brett Kavanaugh in such a manner, no matter how drunk he was, his response would be something along the lines of, “Dude! Let go of my action!” Not, “I’ll give you five minutes to get your hand off my penis.”
 
(Moreover, there’s just the physical implausibility of it. The story says that his friends—plural—pushed his business handward. Was this...a two-man job?)
 
Anyway, it’s probably best for everybody if I move on. 




**I Wish We Could Say We Hardly Knew Ye**
 
Since I spent so much time talking about dicks, I feel like I should say something about New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropping out of the presidential race and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepping on his de Blasio with all of his face-painting. The remarkable thing about de Blasio’s impotent campaign wasn’t its failure to launch. It was more the fact that everyone remarked from the get-go that it would fail. When he broke the news on Morning Joe, there was literally no shock, no gasps of disappointment. It was oddly like the political equivalent of that old observation that successful plane landings and takeoffs aren’t news, only crashes are. But in this case, the crash was the predictable boring story everyone saw coming. De Blasio is like the president of some tiny liberal arts college where all the administrators act like they’re impressed with his woke perorations because the job requires it. As for Trudeau, I honestly can’t muster the left-wing outrage over the racism or the right-wing outrage over the double standard reserved for pretty progressives. I just think it’s funny and that it would take a heart of stone not to laugh.

Canine Update: Everything is great with the doggers because the weather is finally changing. I even got Zoë to play hide and seek with me again, which she won’t do when it’s hot out. Pippa just got her swanky new haircut, which she hated getting (she tried to get in every car outside the groomers), but seems to like because it means the humans are more likely to rub her belly (which is insanely soft post-trimming). Everyone is in a good mood. Gracie even gave Pippa a smooch. There was one rough moment when Zoë was a bit too tough with Pippa, but that wasn’t intentional. She was just pissed the rabbit got away.

##INTRODUCTION

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rule 3 (Stay on topic) and rule 5 (No Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments) don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

t3_d4062a,71,"The Commanding Heights Are No Laughing Matter (Jonah Goldberg's G-File)
Dear Reader (including those of you don’t get the jokes), 
 
Andrew Yang began an answer last night, “Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors…”
 
Personally, I liked his Asian joke from the second debate better:
 
“We need to do the opposite of much of what we're doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math…”
 
I tend to come from the school of thought that the only test for whether a joke works is whether relatively normal and decent people laugh at it. I offer that caveat because the audience matters. What passes for a knee-slapper in the Aryan Nation’s corner of the prison yard is not necessarily funny at Presbyterian Old Age Home.
 
The funny thing about humor is that it is at war with reason, which is why when you explain a joke, you ruin it. (Exception to the rule: When Dug in Up explains, “It is funny because the squirrel gets dead.”) Reason alone should dictate that if racial stereotypes are bad for one race, they should be bad for all races. But audiences do not laugh by reason alone—or by reason at all. They intuitively get where the lines are, and often laugh precisely because they didn’t recognize the lines in the first place.
 
So Yang can play on stereotypes about Asians, in part because they’re positive stereotypes and in part because he’s, you know, Asian, and members of specific groups have more leeway on such things. If Biden had turned to Yang and said, “Andy, you’re Asian, you must know a lot of doctors…” some might have laughed, but not in a way that’d help Biden much.





**Everybody Yang Fun Tonight**
 
Still, as I struggled to fight the soul-leaching ennui of last night’s debate, I thought how wild it would be if everyone on the stage began an answer about healthcare (or anything else) by first invoking an ethnic stereotype.
 
Joe Biden: “Now, I’m Irish so I know a lot of people with cirrhosis.” Or, “Now, I’m Irish, so I know a lot of people who end up in the E.R. on St. Patrick’s Day.”
 
Bernie Sanders: “Now, I’m Jewish, so I know only suckers pay retail.”
 
Kamala Harris: “Now, I’m Asian and African-American, so I know lots of doctors too, but I also know the patients those Asians overcharge.”
 
Elizabeth Warren: “Now, I’m, uh…Can I take a pass on this one?” 




**The Funny Thing About Funny**
 
I haven’t followed the latest developments in the war over comedy too closely. I haven’t seen Dave Chapelle’s new show or Bill Burr’s either (though I did read Kyle Smith’s excellent dissections of each special). But I’ve followed it enough to know there are people who argue with a straight face that there’s such a thing as post-comedy:
 
*Comedians and comedy writers are increasingly pushing the bounds of what it means for something to be a comedy in the most basic sense, rewiring the relationship between comedies and jokes. So what is comedy without jokes? It’s post-comedy.*
 
Remember the old joke:
 
Q: “How many feminists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?”
A: “That’s not funny!”
 
Post-comedy would change the punchline to: “One. Because feminists are just as capable of changing lightbulbs as anyone else. Shame on you for thinking this is something to joke about.”
 
It’s still the same joke; it’s just that now the joke is on the “comedian.”
 
Still, looked at from a certain angle, it’s not all as idiotic as it seems on first blush. I just think people are trying way too hard. Basically, post-comedy humor is a modern form of satire, which has never required laughs. Jonathan Swift’s call to eat the Irish isn’t full of guffaws, but it’s literally a foundational work of satire. 




**The Commanding Heights Are No Laughing Matter**
 
What I find interesting is the sociology of all this.
 
There are lots of kinds of comedy. The Three Stooges were very different from Bob Newhart who was very different from Eddie Murphy or the Coen Brothers or Amy Schumer. It’s telling that the folks going to war against comedy aren’t against comedy per se. Though I’m sure someone has written a brilliant-12,000 word essay on the heteronormative normalization of male violence in the Stooges (“…the consequence-free impact of the bowling ball on Larry’s skull demonstrates how violence is the currency of patriarchical discourse…”). But in general, they’re angry about a particular type of comedy: “politically incorrect” comedy (to use a hackneyed phrase).  
 
So, here’s a theory. Ever since the age of court jesters went out with the Divine Right of Kings, “stand-up comedy” or “political humor” subverted or transgressed authority (and even before that, there was a long tradition of esoteric rebellion in comedy). In other words, politically incorrect humor made fun of the Powers That Be or The Man. What made it politically incorrect wasn’t necessarily its orientation toward conventional politics, but its willingness to tease, test, or tear down taboos. This is why sex and race have always been such rich veins of stand-up comedy, like the old vaudeville humor of the Burlesque, Redd Fox, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Joan Rivers, et al.
 
This is also why, for most people over the age of 40, comedy was vaguely associated with progressivism. I think this was deeply tied to American religiosity. It may not always be obvious, but jokes about sexual taboos are usually at the expense of The Prudes, and until the day before yesterday, prudery was almost synonymous with religious devotion.
 
What’s changed is that a variant of the ancient American Puritan tradition has shed its religious doctrine and orthodoxy and emerged on the left. This isn’t to say that the Puritan tradition is dead on the right—one might even argue it’s undergoing a renaissance, as some folks metaphorically throw the Constitution into the trashcan fire, the brightening light of the embers making it easier to spot the Drag Queen Storytellers in our midst.
 
But it hardly takes a lot of imagination to see the woke Twitter brigades and campus Comstocks as modern day Puritans, furious that someone somewhere is living or thinking wrong. And just as the prudes of old controlled the newspapers, the mainline churches, the Harvards and Yales and, let us not forget, the television networks and movie studios, the new prudes and puritans control the same commanding heights of the culture. What makes it all so confusing to them is that they don’t realize they’ve won the culture war (though in fairness, no one ever thinks he’s won a culture war).
 
When historians write about this period, I suspect they’ll look at the mid-2000s as the inflection point. About 20 years ago, I wrote a piece for NR arguing that The Simpsons—already TV’s longest running sitcom!—constituted a victory for the right in the culture. It wasn’t that the show was conservative, but that it aimed at all of the “false pieties” of the culture:
 
*What should dismay liberals about this is that so many of today’s pieties are constructs of the Left. Conservatives are accustomed to being mocked constantly in the popular culture. But the experience must come as something of a shock for hothouse liberals. For example, Homer Simpson’s mother is a ’60s radical still on the lam. How did she dodge the feds? “I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. I proofread Bobby Seale’s cookbook. And I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden’s Porsche dealership.” Some important pretensions are being punctured here—but not the usual ones.*
 
Around the same time, Andrew Sullivan and Brian Anderson were making the case that South Park represented the same dynamic. Sullivan called it “the best antidote to PC culture we have.” Anderson noted that “Lots of cable comedy, while not traditionally conservative, is fiercely anti-liberal, which as a practical matter often amounts nearly to the same thing.” He quotes Matt Stone, South Park’s co-creator: “I hate conservatives, but I really f**king hate liberals.”
 
What fascinates me is the way that, in the years since, the enforcers of political correctness, perhaps not entirely consciously, recognized the threat of anti-PC humor and cracked down on it. This is exactly what Joseph Schumpeter, borrowing from Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals, would have predicted. What Schumpeter called the New Class of intellectuals (and what Nietzsche called the priestly class) undermine virtues that don’t benefit them by turning them into vices. For Nietzsche, Christianity overturned the old virtues of pride, bravery, and strength and turned them into vices, elevating humility and meekness. For Schumpeter, the new intellectual classes turned industry and entrepreneurialism into rapaciousness and greed.
 
Even if you don’t buy all that, it is remarkable how angry the wokesters are at Dave Chapelle and co. I think it stems from the fact that, even though they prudishly want to police comedy, they don’t want to give up on the vital myth that to be left-wing is to be rebellious. The problem is they can’t have it both ways. They can’t control the commanding the heights of the culture and also claim to be the cultural subversives and rebels.
 
But they can try. Which brings me to… 




**Some Rank Punditry**
 
A new peer-reviewed paper—written by eight(!) researchers—published in the Journal of Archeological Science had some bad news. It turns out that you cannot fashion a blade from frozen human feces. From the abstract:
 
*The ethnographic account of an Inuit man manufacturing a knife from his own frozen feces to butcher and disarticulate a dog has permeated both the academic literature and popular culture. To evaluate the validity of this claim, we tested the basis of that account via experimental archaeology. Our experiments assessed the functionality of knives made from human feces in controlled conditions that provided optimal conditions for success. However, they were not functional. While much research has shown foragers to be technologically resourceful, innovative, and savvy, we suggest that this ethnographic account should no longer be used to support that narrative.*
 
What does this have to do with last night? No much. But I bet you’re glad that, from now until you die, you’ll know that you can’t freeze your crap and hone it into functioning knife. Note to Paul Manafort, plotting that  daring jailbreak: You can take your Tupperware out of the prison kitchen freezer now.
 
Anyway, where was I? Oh, right. Last night. Like the unveiling of that paper, it was a cerebral sh*tshow. With the exception of Joe Biden, everyone on that stage seemed to believe that the country is hungry for more ass-over-tea-kettle political upheaval. Even Klobuchar, who wants to be seen as a moderate alternative to Biden—should they find him one morning in his pajamas eating dirt—isn’t actually promising policy moderation. She says she’ll be more moderate in tone, for the most part.
 
I’ll leave it to others to do all of the nitty-gritty stuff, though interest in these debates has a shorter half-life than a frozen fecal blade left on your dashboard on a hot day. With the exception of Kamala Harris’ giggly tut-tutting over concerns that her agenda would be unconstitutional, the most vexing thing to me was how much their core assumptions mirrored some of the worst assumptions of Trump.
 
Trump has a tendency to think that his supporters—“my people”—are really the only Americans who fully count as Americans, which is one reason why he constantly talks about how he’s so popular with Republicans. Trump also impugns the legitimacy of any institution, rule, or constituency that is not supportive of him or his agenda. He doesn’t oppose rigging the system (see all the cancelled GOP primaries); he just opposes any system that stands in his way.
 
The Democrats last night did the same thing. Again and again, they worked from the assumption that the cheering crowd in the room was a representative sample of America. All of the forces that disagree with what they want to do aren’t fully part of America; they’re problems to be solved. Bernie Sanders last night said:
 
…I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex…
 
This is not a list of “virtually every powerful special interest in the country.” This is a list of the powerful special interests Bernie doesn’t like. Teachers unions, environmentalists, Hollywood, the trial lawyers, Planned Parenthood, the higher education lobby, et al. are all powerful special interests too.
 
The underlying assumption beneath everything—the gun confiscation, the eradication of private insurance, the disdain for the filibuster or constitutional restraints on executive power—is the idea that, after an election, the 51 percent of the voters who cast ballots for the winner should be allowed to pee in the cornflakes of the losers.  
 
Forget the fact that this is a hate crime against the constitutional order and republican government; it’s the frozen fecal knife of electoral strategies. At least Biden understands that, while Trump may be unpopular, what’s really driving a lot of Americans nuts is that politics is becoming a zero-sum game that no one is allowed to escape from.
 
Yes, many Americans crave change. But for millions of them, the change they’re looking for is less drama, less revolution from above, less demonization of dissent, and more normalcy. If you spend your days in an insane asylum trying to stop some dude from having sex with a light socket and explaining that she can’t put her cat in a blender, you might crave change, but the change you’re looking for would probably manifest itself as quietly eating a nice bowl of soup while watching Wheel of Fortune. 
 
They all talked about unifying the country, but in every regard unification would be entirely on their terms, the law and the Constitution be damned. It’s like they think an election is a contest to cut the Gordian knot of our differences by achieving total victory and implementing literally impossible ideas. Every time they promise revolutionary stuff they can’t deliver, the knot gets bigger and tighter, because the other side sees the stakes grow larger. Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, on fiscal terms alone, are bullsh*t. And bullsh*t won’t cut the knot, even if you freeze it and sharpen it to fine point.

Canine Update: The girls are doing great. Thanks to the cooler weather, even Zoë is letting her fur down. In fact, they’ve been playing with each other quite a bit. Zoë even let Pippa chase her, an incredibly rare occurrence. But we did have a bad setback the other morning. Pippa usually tries to keep her tennis ball in her mouth while provisioning the base materials for a frozen fecal blade. But sometimes she drops it, before she drops the other stuff. The other morning she ended up, well, pooping on her own tennis ball. It was not her best moment. But to Pippa’s credit, she will not go near a ball that is even close to that stuff. And it was okay, because I had a backup ball. But then we lost that in the tall grass. Zoë was horrified by the whole affair.",0

Dear Reader (particularly the storm-ravaged residents of Alabama),
 
To borrow a term from social science, this Sharpie story is amazeballs.
 
Even more amazeballs: My spellchecker accepts “amazeballs” as a word, a fact so amazeballs I had to look up the word to discover that Perez Hilton coined it, which means I can never use it again. You might ask, “If you don’t want to use a Perez Hilton portmanteau, why not just rewrite your first sentence?” Well, in the spirit of Sharpie Week, I feel like I should embrace the mumpsimusistic spirit of our times. Mumpsimustic isn’t a word, but a “mumpsimus” is a person who makes a mistake and stubbornly refuses to stop making an error even after the error has been called to their attention (and if lexicological legerdemain or neologistic novelty with the word mumpsimus is wrong, I mumpsimustically refuse to acknowledge my error).
 
The president is of course the most prominent mumpsimus in American life today, but he’s hardly alone. More on that in a moment. But we should take a moment to flesh out this Sharpie thing, for defecations and guffaws. His refusal to let go of the Alabama hurricane-warning-that-wasn’t is such a perfect encapsulation of Trump’s Trumpiness that it approached the Platonic ideal. The only thing that would have been better is if he’d taken a fine-tip Sharpie to the dictionary and written in a definition of “Covfefe” somewhere between covets and Covic and then tweeted a picture of it.
 
I’ve never thought of Trump as a Seinfeld character before, but there is something so quintessentially Seinfeldian about his refusal to let little things go. Jerry Seinfeld (and Larry David) reinvented an old plot device about how the inability to admit a mistake or obsession—the lie that George was a marine biologist, Jerry’s refusal to admit he didn’t know Delores’ name, the fun of making voices with your belly button, the theft of a marble rye, etc.— could drive an entire show.
 
Something similar has been the through-line of so much of the Trump Show. The doubling down on bogus claims of millions of illegal immigrants stealing the popular vote from him, his inaugural crowd size obsession, his claims that China pays the tariffs, his insistence that he met Vladimir Putin because his 60 Minutes interview appeared alongside one with Putin, the refusal to fully and finally admit Russia interfered in the election, and of course his own version of a man-hands controversy: The list is endless. He can’t admit error because he thinks it would show weakness, which is a deeper form of weakness.
 
Remember Trump’s bonkers press conference responding to Mitt Romney’s stop-Trump speech, which cataloged all of Trump’s failed businesses?  Romney said:
 
Look, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business, he didn’t create it. And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.
 
Trump held a press conference showing off a slew of products he claimed proved Romney wrong. It was all bogus. His steak line, sold through Sharper Image (where I buy all my perishable food products), was dead. But he grabbed some Bush Bros. steaks from the Mar-a-Lago freezer and pretended they were Trump Steaks. He grabbed the in-house “magazine” of Mar-a-Lago—which he doesn’t own—and pretended it was the defunct Trump magazine. As for Trump Vodka, he laid out some “Trump Wine”—which isn’t vodka and isn’t owned by Donald Trump—and passed it off as proof of…something. Romney never mentioned Trump Water, but Trump did, claiming that he owned a water company. The proof? The Mar-a-Lago-branded water bottles on offer at the hotel. He didn’t own the company that made them and it wasn’t “Trump Water” anyway. 
 
But hey, it worked for him. And this stuff usually works for him because, as any great con man will tell you, the mark wants to believe.




**Story Trumps Fact**
 
Longtime readers may recall that for years I’ve used a certain analogy to explain my view of liberal media bias. For the newbies, I’ll set it up. I honestly believe, deep in my heart, that every reasonable person knows there is such a thing as liberal media bias. It’s as real as cancer and Newark, New Jersey. Therefore, the only legitimate disagreements on the subject aren’t over its existence, but on its scope, significance, and magnitude. That’s why when conservatives hear liberals, particularly liberal journalists, pretend it doesn’t exist, it can drive us a little bonkers.
 
So here’s the analogy: It’s like the college roommate who takes your last beer. It’s not a big deal, really. But it is annoying.
 
“Dude, you took my last beer.”
“No I didn’t.”
“Yes, you did. Just admit it. I don’t really care. But you did.”
“I did not take the last beer.”
“Come on man, I saw you take it out of the fridge.”
“Nope.”
“You’re drinking it right now! Just admit it! Say it, damn it! Say you took my last beer!”
 
And then you turn into Sam Kinison in Back to School screaming “Say it!” into his face. The point is that a lot of us could just move on if the media were honest about itself. But it can’t be, not fully, because it’s too invested in its self-image as somehow above the fray and non-partisan.
 
The funny thing is this is where we are on Sharpie Week. This is Day 6 of an incandescently stupid story, but the press can’t let it go and neither can Trump, and I’m here for it. Yes, in a sense it’s a morally grotesque collective action problem. The press is obsessed with proving to the world that Trump lies—which he does, constantly. And Trump’s fans and allies know he does, but they refuse to give the media the satisfaction of admitting it (and his political allies are terrified of angering Trump or his fans, so they pretend he doesn’t lie). At some point the press’s obsession with the lie becomes the story instead of the lie itself. Then conservatives do the whataboutist pounce, which the press invites because its daily zeal shows more concern about exposing Trump than about exposing lies by Democrats. And… everything gets even dumber in the process.
 
Seriously, step out of the ludicrousness of it all and just imagine you’re standing amidst the rubble of your Dorian-devastated home and you turn on the TV (which miraculously survived for the purposes of this hypothetical) to discover that the president is—or is happy to seem—more concerned with defending a really minor and understandable error than with directing relief efforts or expressing sympathy with the victims, and the press is equally obsessed with not letting the president off the hook. 




**Mumpsimuses All The Way Down**
 
I think Andrew Egger is right that historians will have a field day with what he calls “Sharpiegate.” But for all that this Princess and the Pea story for the media age tells us about Trump, it’s worth moving the camera lens back a bit. Trump’s obsession with his image is just a small example of our society-wide obsession with narrative-maintenance. The refusal to admit error often stems from a deep insecurity about the rightness of your position, of the story you want to tell and have others believe.
 
In my book, I argue that a civilization is just the story we tell ourselves about ourselves. Both politics and what we call the culture war can be boiled down to an argument over whose story will be accepted as reality. This in itself is neither bad nor good; it’s simply the nature of how humans create an ecosystem of collective understanding about who “we”—or “they”—are. We can’t help but invest more significance in some facts over others, because some facts are central to our story and some are distractions from it. For instance, “Drag Queen Story Hours” are real. Whether or not they actually present a “global threat” is a matter of debate.
 
The problem comes when the narrative becomes more important than the facts, and useful errors become too useful to discard. The examples, large and small, are everywhere:
 
• The New York Times recently announced that the story of America starts with the original sin of slavery and can’t be understood any other way. To this end, it has revived the “King Cotton” narrative (a storyline near and dear to Karl Marx’s heart: “Without slavery there would be no cotton; without cotton there would be no modern industry...”). The problem is that this story isn’t true.
 
• I doubt there are many political reporters who honestly believe that Stacey Abrams was robbed of her rightful victory. But you’ll be hard pressed to find many who will say so, never mind say so with the same righteous indignation they reserve for Trump’s aspersions on democratic norms.
 
• Racism is a real problem, but the problem is nowhere near as big as you’d be led to believe if you just followed the mainstream media. The modest though lamentable P.R. successes of the alt-right notwithstanding, America is still profoundly less racist than it was a generation ago. Hate crimes happen, and some of them are truly horrific. But the press seems more interested in hate crimes that fit the narrative than in hate crimes per se.  
 
• Joe Biden insists he opposed the Iraq war just moments after he voted for it. Trump insists he opposed the war from the beginning, which he didn’t.
 
• And then there’s the depressingly awful debate over guns. On a recent episode of The Remnant, Charles Cooke goes on a stemwinder about the myth that the Second Amendment wasn’t intended as an individual right. Spoiler: It was. Every day, anti-gun types vent a spleen in Twitter about how no one should point out that the “AR” in AR-15 doesn’t stand for assault rifle. Every day, virtually every Democratic candidate speaks with invincible certainty about the number of mass shootings in this country, using a bogus measurement.  
 
The statistics over “equal pay” are as real and reliable as the prop-swords in a fifth-grade play of The Three Musketeers. The Bloomberg “reporter” who mistook sarcasm for anti-Semitism won’t admit he was wrong. The woman who called J.D. Vance a racist refuses to concede her error. People still insist Democracy in Chains isn’t a hot mess. Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyer all but admitted—in lawyerly fashion—that the Kavanaugh smear was a political hit job from the outset. I could go on and on.
 
Now, I recognize that I’m using examples that conservatives generally agree with. I do that for a few reasons. First, I’m a conservative. Second, because I think there’s a real asymmetry between left and right when it comes to shaping the narrative. The left dominates universities, most of the media, including Hollywood and publishing, and uses this position to shape the narrative constantly.
 
Finally, because I started with Trump, so I figured I should give equal time.
 
Still, it’s worth noting how Trump has mumpsimized vast swaths of the right. From conservative intellectuals to leaders of the Christian Right to various TV talking heads, the refusal to concede error—Trump’s errors or their own estimations of Trump—has become institutionalized. Stuart Varney’s refusal to concede that Trump lies—at all!—is a perfect example of the phenomenon.  
 
But the refusal to credit the reality of Trump’s character isn’t the whole of the story, because there are policy consequences to the riot of mumpsimuseosity on the right. When Trump refuses to admit his errors, his supporters often happily go right along with him. The Tea Partiers and Freedom Caucusers have abandoned one constitutional and fiscal commitment after another. The inevitable financial crisis coming our way is now a massive example of a bipartisan refusal to admit error. And it’s only getting worse as the fight in Washington is over more tax cuts versus spending tens of trillions on a Green New Deal.
 
To paraphrase Tracy Morgan, we’re living every week like it’s Sharpie Week, and there’s no end in sight. 





**Existential Musings**
 
Every now and then, I come up with a syndicated column topic that would be better suited for G-File. Today’s is a good example, and it dovetails a bit with today’s “news”letter. I noticed how Democrats and reporters often use the term “existential crisis” as a synonym for an existential threat, when in fact they're very different things. An existential crisis is when you start asking yourself in the bathroom mirror “Who am I?” or “Is this all there is?” or find yourself making a replica of Devil’s Tower out of your mashed potatoes and musing about abandoning your family for the real thing. To continue the above discussion, it’s when you lose the plot of your own story. An existential threat is when you climb a tree to get away from a hungry grizzly bear only to discover that grizzly bears are excellent tree climbers. But the two things are related. I think the left’s embrace of socialism and the right’s embrace of nationalism or “post-liberal Catholic integralism” are responses to a kind of existential crisis in America today. We’re losing the plot of who we are and we’re grasping for some new story. And key tools for doing just that are existential threats. We are wired to find a great deal of meaning in existential threats. For many on the left, climate change (and white supremacy) are filling the void; for many on the right, it’s immigration, or Drag Queen Story hour, or simply the Left. Flight 93 arguments are born of existential crises, and the claim of existential threats is what gives them binding power.

Canine Update: There are some strange things afoot (apaw?) at home. Pippa is becoming more aggressive (in a totally non-aggressive way) at getting her fair share of attention. Zoë is getting jealous, but she’s not being mean about it. Instead, she’s trying to steal Pippa’s act. Zoë is also becoming weirdly addicted to scritches and pats. I’m used to this at home. But it’s becoming a bit of a problem in the car. Zoë typically rides shotgun with me in the car, and every now and then at a stoplight I’ll reach over to give her some love. But when the light turns green and I put my right hand back on the wheel, she’ll reach over with her paw and try to pull my arm back. Anyway, they’re happy doggos.

Dear Reader (including the poor Biden staffers who have to white-knuckle their armrests when not sucking down unfiltered Marlboros every time Joe Biden gives an interview),  
 
If you’ve never heard the Milton Friedman shovels and spoons story, you will (and I don’t just mean here). Because everyone on the right tells some version of it at some point. The other Uncle Miltie (i.e., not the epically endowed comedic genius) goes to Asia or Africa or South America and is taken on a tour of some public works project in a developing country. Hundreds of laborers are digging with shovels. Milton asks the official in charge something like, “Why use shovels when earth moving equipment would be so much more efficient?”
 
The official replies that this is a jobs program and using shovels creates more jobs.
 
Friedman guffaws and asks, “In that case: Why not use spoons?”
 
The story might not be true, but the insight is timeless.
 
Here’s another story: When I was in college, we were debating in intro to philosophy the differences between treating men and women “equally” versus treating them the “same.” At first blush, the two things sound synonymous, but they’re not (indeed the difference illuminates the chasm of difference between classical liberalism and socialism, but that’s a topic for another day). I pointed out that there were some firefighter programs that had different physical requirements for male applicants and female ones (this was before it was particularly controversial—outside discussions of Foucault—to assume there were clear differences between sexes). Female applicants had to complete an obstacle course carrying a 100-pound dummy, but men had to carry a 200-pound dummy, or something like that. A puckish freshperson named Jonah Goldberg said: “I don’t really care if a firefighter is a man, a woman, or a gorilla, I’d just like them to be able to rescue me from a fire.”
 
A woman sitting in front of me wheeled around and womansplained to me that “you can always just hire two women.”
 
I shot back something like, “You could also hire 17 midgets, that’s not the point.”
 
(I apologize for using the word midget, which wasn’t on the proscribed terms list at the time.)
 
But here’s the thing: Sometimes it is the point. Whether you’re talking about spoons or little people, the case for efficiency is just one case among many. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s an important one, but it’s not the only one. Sometimes older children are told to bring their little brothers or sisters along on some trip. They’ll complain, “But they’ll just slow us down!” or, “But they aren’t allowed on the big kid rides.” Parents understand the point, but they are not prioritizing efficiency over love. Or, they’re prioritizing a different efficiency: Not being stuck with a little kid who’s crying all day because he or she was left behind.
 
One of my favorite scenes in the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer is when the chess tutor Bruce Pandolfini, played by Ben Kingsley, tells the chess prodigy’s parents that they have to forbid their son from playing pickup chess in the park because he learns bad chess habits there. The mom says “Not playing in the park would kill him. He loves it.”

Kingsley replies, accurately, that it “just makes my job harder.”
 
And the mom says, “Then your job is harder.”
 
I love that. I love it precisely because it recognizes that good parents recognize that there are trade-offs in life and that the best option isn’t always the most efficient one.

This is one of those places where you can see how wisdom and expertise can diverge from one another.




**The Unity of Goodness**
 
Efficiency can mean different things in different contexts. In business, it means profit maximization (or cost reduction, which is often the same thing). In sports, it means winning. Always giving the ball to the best player annoys the other players who want their own shot at glory, but so long as he can be counted on to score, most coaches will err on the side of winning. Starting one-legged players will wildly improve a basketball team’s diversity score, but it’s unlikely to improve the score that matters to coaches—or fans.
 
I’ve long argued that there’s something in the progressive mind that dislikes this whole line of thinking. They often tend to find the idea of trade-offs to be immoral or offensive. I call it the “unity of goodness” worldview. Once you develop an ear for it, you can hear it everywhere. “I refuse to believe that economic growth has to come at the expense of the environment.” “There’s no downside to putting women in combat.” “I don’t want to live in a society where families have to choose between X and Y,” or “I for one reject the idea that we have to sacrifice security for freedom—or freedom for security.” Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were masters at declaring that all hard choices were “false choices”—as if only mean-spirited people would say you can’t have your cake and eat it too. 





**Saint Greta**
 
Nowhere is this mindset more on display in environmentalism. Everyone hawking the Green New Deal insists that it’s win-win all the way down. It’s Bastiat’s broken window parable on an industrialized scale. Spending trillions to switch to less efficient forms of energy will boost economic growth and create jobs, they insist. I’d have much more respect for these arguments if they simply acknowledged that doing a fraction of what they want will come at considerable cost.
 
Consider Greta Thunberg, the latest child redeemer of the climate change movement. She hates planes because they spew CO2. That’s why she sailed from Sweden to a conference in New York. As symbolism, it worked, at least for the people who already agree with her. But in economic terms, she might as well have raised the Spoon Banner off the main mast of her multi-million-dollar craft (that may have a minimal carbon footprint now, but required an enormous carbon down-payment to create). The organizers of this stunt had to fly two people to New York to bring the ship back across the Atlantic. And scores of reporters flew across the Atlantic to cover her heroic act of self-denial. Her nautical virtue signaling came at a price.
 
The organizers insist that they will buy carbon offsets to compensate for the damage done. But that’s just clever accounting. The cost is still real. And that’s not the only cost. It took her fifteen days to get to America. In other words, she actually proved the point of many of her critics. Fossil fuels come with costs all their own—geopolitical, environmental, etc.—but the upside of those downsides is far greater efficiency. If you want to get across the Atlantic in seven hours instead of two weeks, you need fossil fuels. The efficiency of modern technology reduces costs by giving human beings more time to do other stuff. 




**The Conservative Planners**
 
The unity of goodness mindset has been spreading to the right these days as well. The new conservative critics of the free market see the efficiency of the market as a threat to other good things. And they’re right, as Joseph Schumpeter explained decades ago. For instance, just as earth-moving equipment replaces ditch-diggers in the name of efficiency, robots replace crane operators, and the communities that depended on those jobs often suffer as a result.
 
I have no quarrel with this observation. My problem is with the way they either sell their program as cost-free, or pretend that the right experts can run things better from Washington. They know which jobs or industries need the state to protect them from the market. They know how to run Facebook or Google to improve the Gross National Virtue Index. Many of the same people who once chuckled at the Spoons story now nod sagely. I don’t mean to say that there’s no room for government to regulate economic affairs. But I am at a loss as to why I should suspend my skepticism for right-wingers when they work from the same assumptions of the left-wingers I’ve been arguing with for decades. 




**Embracing Trumpism to Own Trump**
 
Instead I want—or I guess need—to talk about another trade-off. I’ve been very reluctant to weigh in on the Joe Walsh project for a bunch of reasons. The biggest is that I am friends with some of the people cheering it on. But I think I have to offer my take.
 
I don’t get it.
 
Oh, I certainly understand the desire to see a primary challenger to Trump. I share that desire. And I understand the political calculation behind the effort. It’s like when one little league team brings in some dismayingly brawny and hirsute player from Costa Rica as a ringer. The other teams feel like they have to get their own 22-year-olds with photoshopped birth certificates in order to compete. My friend Bill Kristol is convinced that Trump must be defeated and that Walsh is just the mongoose to take on the Cobra-in-Chief.
 
I try not to recycle metaphors or analogies too much, but this seems like another example of a Col. Nicholson move. As I’ve written before, Col. Nicholson was the Alec Guinness character in The Bridge Over the River Kwai. The commanding officer of a contingent of mostly British POWs being held by the Japanese, Nicholson at first follows the rules and refuses to cooperate with his captors in their effort to use British captives as slave labor for a bridge project. But then his pride kicks in and he decides he will show the Japanese what real soldiering is like, agreeing to build the bridge as a demonstration of British superiority in civil engineering. [Spoiler alert] It’s only at the end of the film that he realizes that building the bridge may have been a kind of short-sighted moral victory, but in reality he was helping the Japanese kill allied troops because the bridge was going to be used for shipping Japanese troops and ammunition. When this realization finally arrives, he exclaims, “My God, what have I done?”
 
Walsh’s primary brief against Trump is that Trump is temperamentally unfit for office and a con man. Fair enough. But he has to focus his indictment on Trump’s erratic behavior. Why? Because he’s a terrible spokesman for much of the rest of the case against Trump. I may not call myself “Never Trump” any more, but I was in 2016. And back then, the argument against Trump wasn’t simply that he was erratic. It was also that he wasn’t a conservative, that he happily dabbled in racism and bigotry, and that he was crude, ill-informed, and narcissistically incapable of putting his personal interests and ego aside for the good of the country. I’m sure I’m leaving a few other things out. But you get the point.
 
Walsh may be sincere in his remorse over all the racist and incendiary things he said in the very recent past. He may regret supporting his anti-Semitic friend Paul Nehlen, though I haven’t found evidence of that. But none of that history should be seen as qualifications for the presidency, the Republican nomination, or support from conservatives.
 
And yet, it is precisely these things that make him attractive to his conservative supporters. Trump is an entertainer who trolls his enemies with offensive statements for attention, so let’s find someone who does the exact same thing!
 
Walsh may have been a one-term congressman, but his true vocation was as a shock-jock trolling provocateur. It’s ironic. As I’ve argued countless times, much of Trump’s bigotry in 2016 stemmed less from any core convictions than from a deep belief that the GOP’s base voters were bigoted and he needed to feed them red meat. Trump's reluctance to repudiate David Duke derived primarily from his ridiculous assumption that Duke had a large constituency he didn’t want to offend. He may have believed the Birther stuff, but he peddled it because that’s what his fans wanted. And Joe Walsh was one of those fans.
 
It may also be true that Walsh never really believed most of the bilge he was peddling and that he was doing the same thing Trump did—feeding the trolls—on a smaller scale. But if that’s the case, then he’s a con man, too.
 
I don’t want to beat up on Walsh too much because, again, his epiphany may be sincere. There are lots of people who pushed certain arguments too far only to recognize that the payoff was Trump and the transformation of conservatism into a form of right-wing identity politics. There are a lot of Col. Nicholsons out there. And I have too much respect for Bill Kristol to believe that he would lend his support to someone he believed to be as bigoted as the man Walsh seemed to be a few years ago.
 
But from where I sit, the prize we should keep our eyes on isn’t defeating Trump; it’s keeping conservatism from succumbing to Trumpism after he’s gone. This isn’t easy, and no tactic is guaranteed to be successful. We’ve never been here before. My own approach is to agree with Trump policies when I think they’re right—judges, buying Greenland, etc.—and disagreeing when they’re wrong. My own crutch is to simply tell the truth as I see it, regardless of whether it fits into some larger political agenda or strategy. Truth is always a legitimate defense of any statement.
 
But for those who see themselves as political players as well as public intellectuals, I think this is a terrible mistake. Intellectually and morally, the case for continued opposition to—or skepticism about, Trump cannot—or rather must not—be reduced to simple Trump hatred. But by rallying around Walsh—instead of, say, Mark Sanford, or Justin Amash, or, heh, General Mattis—that’s what it looks like. Because you can’t say, “I’m standing on principle in my opposition to a bigoted troll and con man as the leader of my party and my country and that’s why I am supporting a less successful bigoted troll and con man for president.” Walsh isn’t a conservative alternative to Trump; he’s an alternative version of Trump. And his candidacy only makes sense if you take the “binary choice” and “Flight 93” logic of 2016 and cast Trump in the role of Hillary.
 
Let’s imagine the Walsh gambit works beyond anyone’s dreams and Joe Walsh ends up getting the GOP nomination (a fairly ludicrous thought experiment, I know). If so, I have no doubt that my friend Bill Kristol will say, a la Col. Nicholson, “My God, what have I done.”

Canine Update: It’s good to be home. The beasts were delighted to see us. Everything is settling back to normal, except for one intriguing development. I think Zoë has finally had enough with Pippa’s tennis ball routine. The other day on the midday walk with the pack, Kirsten managed to film Zoë putting an end to the tennis ball shenanigans. She took the ball and buried it. It was, to use an inapt phrase, a baller move—and she was unapologetic about it. Maybe she just didn’t like all the commotion with the other dogs, because she’s tolerant of the tennis ball stuff again. Or maybe she was being protective of her sister given that many of the other dogs in the pack are known thieves. Regardless, they’re doing well and having fun.
 
If you haven’t tuned into The Remnant lately, please give it another try. The first episode of the week was with Niall Ferguson and the feedback has been great. The latest episode is with my friend and AEI colleague Adam White on all things constitutional. Word of mouth is really important in building up audiences, so if you can spread the word about The Remnant or this “news”letter, I’d be grateful.",0
